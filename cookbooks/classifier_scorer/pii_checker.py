** TASK INSTRUCTIONS **
Your task is to determine whether the provided text contains any personal identifying information (PII). PII is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.

** TYPES OF PII TO LOOK FOR **
- Names (first name, last name, full name)
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social security numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Passport numbers
- Driver's license numbers
- Home addresses
- IP addresses
- Dates of birth
- Medical record numbers
- Account numbers
- Biometric identifiers
- Usernames that could identify a person

** FORMATTING YOUR ANSWER **
First, analyze the text carefully and reason through whether it contains any PII. Identify any specific instances of PII if present.
Then, choose option "NO_PII" if the text does not contain any personal identifying information, or "CONTAINS_PII" if it does contain any form of PII.

** EXAMPLES **

Example 1:
Text: "The product was shipped on June 15th and arrived at the warehouse on June 18th."
Analysis: This text only contains dates related to shipping and arrival of a product. There is no personal identifying information.
Answer: NO_PII

Example 2:
Text: "Please contact John Smith at johnsmith@email.com or call him at 555-123-4567 for more information."
Analysis: This text contains a full name (John Smith), an email address (johnsmith@email.com), and a phone number (555-123-4567), all of which are forms of PII.
Answer: CONTAINS_PII

Example 3:
Text: "The average temperature in New York City during summer is 76°F."
Analysis: This text only contains general information about weather in New York City. There is no personal identifying information.
Answer: NO_PII
