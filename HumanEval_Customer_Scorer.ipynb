    "## 1. Understanding HumanEval\n",
    "\n",
    "HumanEval is a benchmark dataset created by OpenAI for evaluating code generation models. Introduced in the paper [\"Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), it contains 164 Python programming problems designed to test functional correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What HumanEval Contains\n",
    "Each problem includes:\n",
    "- **Function signature and docstring**: The problem description\n",
    "- **Test cases**: Automated tests to verify correctness  \n",
    "- **Canonical solution**: Reference implementation\n",
    "- **Entry point**: Function name to test\n",
    "\n",
    "### How HumanEval Evaluates Code\n",
    "HumanEval evaluates model outputs by dynamically building a Python program that stitches together the **Function signature and docstring**, the **model’s generated solution**, and the **test cases**. This combined program is then executed in a sandbox to verify whether the generated code passes all test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```check_correctness``` function orchestrates this process: assembles the prompt, generated solution, and tests into a single program, and executes the script in a sandboxed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Construct the check program and run it.\n",
    "check_program = (\n",
    "    problem[\"prompt\"] +      # Function signature + docstring\n",
    "    completion +            # Generated code\n",
    "    \"\\n\" +\n",
    "    problem[\"test\"] +       # Test cases\n",
    "    \"\\n\" +\n",
    "    f\"check({problem['entry_point']})\"  # Call the test function\n",

    "# WARNING: This executes untrusted model-generated code\n",
    "exec(check_program, exec_globals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is **pass/fail**: if all test cases pass without exceptions, the code is correct. If any test fails or the code crashes, it's incorrect."

    "### Pass@k\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of stopping at a simple pass/fail, HumanEval extend this to compute the **Pass@k** statistic. Pass@k measures the probability that at least one of the top-k generated solutions is correct, given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n** = total number of generated solutions  \n",
    "- **c** = number of correct solutions among them  \n",
    "- **k** = how many solutions we sample  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we generate **n = 5** completions and some are correct, we can compute **Pass@1** (the chance a single sampled solution is correct) and **Pass@3** (the chance at least one out of three sampled solutions is correct). This provides a more practical view of model performance, since in real use cases we usually sample multiple completions and care whether any of them solves the problem."

Logic is correct for the problem as written. However, if the input string has no palindromic suffix (should not happen, since the whole string is at least a suffix), there is no explicit return at the end; this results in `None` being implicitly returned in that hypothetical case (minor edge case). Readable and clear.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Generation 3**  \\nSCORE: 0.5  \\nREASON: Matches Generation 2, but improves readability by extracting the suffix and prefix. Same minor \"missing explicit return\" for non-palindromic inputs (which can\\'t actually occur here); also, same minor best-practice issues as above. Naming, structure, and comments are good.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Generation 4**  \\nSCORE: 0.0  \\nREASON: Lacks explicit handling of the empty string (would return `string + string[:-1][::-1]`, which gives unexpected results for empty input: `\\'\\' + \\'\\'[::-1] = \\'\\'`, so coincidentally okay, but not by design). More importantly, if no suffix is a palindrome (should not occur), returns `string + string[:-1][::-1]` (omits last char in mirroring), which is incorrect (see test cases: `make_palindrome(\"a\")` would return `\\'a\\'`, but this logic would be flawed for others). Poor clarity on else case. Less robust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Generation 5**  \\nSCORE: 0.5  \\nREASON: Checks if input is already a palindrome (optimization). Main loop is correct. Final return still has the logic bug of Generation 4: in the theoretically impossible case no suffix is a palindrome, returns `string + string[:-1][::-1]` which is faulty for some edge cases. However, in practice, for this problem setup it works, so only a minor issue. No explicit empty string handling, but works by default.
