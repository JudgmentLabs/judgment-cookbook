    "## 1. Understanding HumanEval\n",
    "\n",
    "HumanEval is a benchmark dataset created by OpenAI for evaluating code generation models. Introduced in the paper [\"Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), it contains 164 Python programming problems designed to test functional correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What HumanEval Contains\n",
    "Each problem includes:\n",
    "- **Function signature and docstring**: The problem description\n",
    "- **Test cases**: Automated tests to verify correctness  \n",
    "- **Canonical solution**: Reference implementation\n",
    "- **Entry point**: Function name to test\n",
    "\n",
    "### How HumanEval Evaluates Code\n",
    "HumanEval evaluates model outputs by dynamically building a Python program that stitches together the **Function signature and docstring**, the **model’s generated solution**, and the **test cases**. This combined program is then executed in a sandbox to verify whether the generated code passes all test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```check_correctness``` function orchestrates this process: assembles the prompt, generated solution, and tests into a single program, and executes the script in a sandboxed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Construct the check program and run it.\n",
    "check_program = (\n",
    "    problem[\"prompt\"] +      # Function signature + docstring\n",
    "    completion +            # Generated code\n",
    "    \"\\n\" +\n",
    "    problem[\"test\"] +       # Test cases\n",
    "    \"\\n\" +\n",
    "    f\"check({problem['entry_point']})\"  # Call the test function\n",

    "# WARNING: This executes untrusted model-generated code\n",
    "exec(check_program, exec_globals)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The evaluation is **pass/fail**: if all test cases pass without exceptions, the code is correct. If any test fails or the code crashes, it's incorrect."

    "### Pass@k\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of stopping at a simple pass/fail, HumanEval extend this to compute the **Pass@k** statistic. Pass@k measures the probability that at least one of the top-k generated solutions is correct, given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n** = total number of generated solutions  \n",
    "- **c** = number of correct solutions among them  \n",
    "- **k** = how many solutions we sample  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we generate **n = 5** completions and some are correct, we can compute **Pass@1** (the chance a single sampled solution is correct) and **Pass@3** (the chance at least one out of three sampled solutions is correct). This provides a more practical view of model performance, since in real use cases we usually sample multiple completions and care whether any of them solves the problem."
