Section 16 of the Offer to Purchase titled ""Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals"" is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following after the last sentence thereof:

Litigation. Beginning on March 11, 2019, six putative class-action lawsuits were filed on behalf of purported IMDZ stockholders: the first captioned Tullman v. Immune Design Corp., et al., No. 2:19-cv-00350 (filed March 11, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington) (the ""Tullman Complaint""); the second captioned Hutchings v. Immune Design Corp., et al., No. 2:19-cv-00373 (filed March 14, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington) (the ""Hutchings Complaint""); the third captioned Walker v.

Immune Design Corp., et al., No. 1:19-cv-02398 (filed March 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) (the ""Reed Complaint""); the fifth captioned Gray v. Immune Design Corp., et al., No. 1:19-cv-02410 (filed March 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) (the ""Gray Complaint""); and the sixth captioned Witmer v.

IMDZ has not been able to electronically access the Reed Complaint. The Walker Compliant was voluntarily dismissed on March 18, 2019. The Complaints were filed against IMDZ and each member of IMDZ's board of directors. The Witmer Complaint also names Purchaser and Parent as defendants. The Complaints assert claims for violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and, in the case of the Gray Complaint and the Witmer Complaint, Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, and allege, among other things, that certain material information was omitted from IMDZ's 14D-9, which the Complaints allege render the information disclosed materially misleading. The Complaints seek to enjoin the proposed transaction, or in the event the proposed transaction is consummated, to recover money damages.

Item 8. Additional Information.

The sentence on page 40 of the Schedule 14D-9 under the heading ""Legal Proceedings"" in Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and restated as follows:

""Beginning on March 11, 2019, six putative class-action lawsuits were filed on behalf of purported Immune Design stockholders: the first captioned Tullman v.

Immune Design has not been able to electronically access the Reed Complaint. The Walker Complaint was voluntarily dismissed on March 18, 2019. The Complaints were filed against Immune Design and each member of Immune Design's board of directors. The Complaints assert claims for violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) and, in the case of the Gray Complaint and the Witmer Complaint, Section 14 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act and allege, among other things, that this Schedule 14D-9 omits certain material information, which the Complaints allege render the information disclosed materially misleading. The Complaints seek to enjoin the proposed transaction, or in the event the proposed transaction is consummated, to recover money damages.""

While Immune Design believes that the disclosure set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 complies fully with applicable law, to moot the Complaints, avoid nuisance, possible expense and delay, and provide additional information to its stockholders, Immune Design has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the supplemental disclosure set forth herein (the ""Supplemental Disclosure""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Immune Design specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

The parties have also agreed that, if the Company termination fee is payable as a result of an acceptance by the Board of a superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled ""The Amended Merger Agreement--Other Covenants and Agreements; The Advanced Disposal Board Recommendation; Change of Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception""), Waste Management's and Merger Sub's right to terminate the amended merger agreement and receive payment of the Company termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Waste Management and Merger Sub for any loss suffered by Waste Management or Merger Sub as a result of a breach by Advanced Disposal of its obligations with respect to the non-solicitation provisions under the amended merger agreement. In addition, the parties have agreed that Advanced Disposal's right to terminate the amended merger agreement and receive payment of the Waste Management termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Advanced Disposal against Waste Management and Merger Sub for any loss suffered by Advanced Disposal as a result of a breach by Waste Management or Merger Sub of certain of its obligations with respect to regulatory matters under the amended merger agreement. The parties further agreed that Advanced Disposal will not have any right to seek money damages due to Waste Management's breach of the regulatory covenant in circumstances where the Waste Management termination fee is not payable unless the amended merger agreement is terminated due to Waste Management's willful breach, in which case, Advanced Disposal can seek damages up to $250,000,000. Advanced Disposal, however, retains the right to seek specific performance.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (page 83)

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the original merger agreement, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court for the District of Delaware, and one putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit for St. Johns County, Florida. The two lawsuits filed in the District Court for the District of Delaware were captioned Krieger v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. et al, No. 1:19-cv-00904-UNA (filed on May 14, 2019) (which we refer to as the ""Krieger complaint"") and Sabatini v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. et al, No. 1:19-cv-00919-UNA (filed on May 17, 2019) (which we refer to as the ""Sabatini complaint""). The lawsuit filed in Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit for St. Johns County, Florida was captioned Bushansky v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. Waste Management, Inc., et al, No. 90090027 (filed on May 24, 2019) (which we refer to as the ""Bushansky complaint"", and together with the Krieger complaint and the Sabatini complaint, we refer to as the ""complaints""). The Krieger complaint and the Sabatini complaint generally alleged that the preliminary proxy statement, filed by Advanced Disposal on May 10, 2019, was materially incomplete and misleading, and therefore in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and other securities laws, rules and regulations. The Bushansky complaint generally alleged that (i) the directors of Advanced Disposal breached their fiduciary duties, including by disseminating the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 23, 2019, which allegedly was materially incomplete and misleading, and (ii) Advanced Disposal and Waste Management aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors of Advanced Disposal. On June 28, 2019, the respective plaintiffs of the complaints each filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. The Krieger complaint and the Sabatini complaint were dismissed on June 28, 2019, and the Bushansky complaint was dismissed on July 2, 2019.

No additional lawsuits have been filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the amended merger agreement, as of July 23, 2020, the date immediately prior to the filing date of this proxy statement. However, additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of the pending or any potential future lawsuits. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the merger, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin the completion of the merger.

2019-06-21 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1585790/000094787119000461/ss141276_8k.htm]:
Item 8.01 Other Events.

As previously disclosed and reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 15, 2019 by Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Advanced Disposal"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), on April 14, 2019, the Company, Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Waste Management""), and Everglades Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Waste Management (""Merger Sub""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the ""Merger"" and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the ""Transactions""), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waste Management. On May 10, 2019, Advanced Disposal filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with the Transactions, and on May 23, 2019, Advanced Disposal filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement in connection with the Transactions (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement""), which was mailed to Advanced Disposal's stockholders of record on or about May 24, 2019.

In connection with the Transactions, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court for the District of Delaware, and one putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit for St. Johns County, Florida. The two lawsuits filed in the District Court for the District of Delaware are captioned Krieger v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. et al, No. 1:19-cv-00904-UNA (filed on May 14, 2019) (the ""Krieger Complaint"") and Sabatini v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. et al, No. 1:19-cv-00919-UNA (filed on May 17, 2019) (the ""Sabatini Complaint""). The lawsuit filed in Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit for St. Johns County, Florida is captioned Bushansky v. Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. Waste Management, Inc., et al, No. 90090027 (filed on May 24, 2019) (the ""Bushansky Complaint,"" all three complaints, collectively, the ""Complaints,"" and all three lawsuits, collectively, the ""Merger Litigation""). The Krieger Complaint and Sabatini Complaint generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement, filed by Advanced Disposal on May 10, 2019, was materially incomplete and misleading, and therefore in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and other securities laws, rules and regulations. The Bushansky Complaint generally alleges that (i) the directors of Advanced Disposal breached their fiduciary duties, including by disseminating the Definitive Proxy Statement, which allegedly was materially incomplete and misleading, and (ii) Advanced Disposal and Waste Management aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors of Advanced Disposal. Each Complaint generally seeks, among other things, injunctive relief, including to enjoin the Special Meeting (as defined below) or completion of the Merger, damages in the event the Merger is consummated and an award of plaintiffs' costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' and expert fees and expenses.

The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the Transactions and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Each of the plaintiffs has agreed that, following the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, they will dismiss their respective actions in their entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only and without prejudice to all other members of the putative classes. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

This Current Report on Form 8-K will not affect the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger or the timing of the special meeting of the Company's stockholders scheduled for June 28, 2019 at Crosswater Hall at Nocatee Welcome Center located at 245 Nocatee Center Way, Ponte Vedra, FL 32081 beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time (the ""Special Meeting""). The Company's board of directors continues to recommend that Advanced Disposal's stockholders vote ""FOR"" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, ""FOR"" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to Advanced Disposal's named executive officers in connection with the Merger and contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and ""FOR"" the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The complaints allege that Array and its directors, and, in the Kent Complaint and the Wang Complaint, Pfizer and Purchaser, violated Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder because the Schedule 14D-9 is materially deficient, and that Array's directors (acting in their capacity as control persons of Array) and, solely in the Kent Complaint, Pfizer (which the Kent Complaint alleges should also be deemed to be a control person of Array for purposes of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act), violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by filing a materially deficient Schedule 14D-9. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event the Transactions are consummated and (iii) plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees. The defendants believe the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit.""

2019-07-22 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805022/000119312519199048/d778989d8k.htm]:
Item 8.01. | Other Events.

On May 10, 2019, Buckeye Partners, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Buckeye""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Hercules Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), Hercules Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (""ServiceCo""), and Buckeye GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the ""General Partner""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (the ""merger""), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Parent.

Since the May 10, 2019 announcement of the merger agreement, six putative class action complaints and two individual complaints have been filed against Buckeye and the members of the board of directors of the General Partner (the ""Board""). The eight complaints are captioned as follows: Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (filed on June 13, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the ""Curtis Action""), Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128 (filed on June 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Kent Action""), John Greer v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (filed on June 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Greer Action""), Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (filed on June 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Luers Action""), Michael Weston, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01208 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Weston Action""), Heather McManus, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06000 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""McManus Action""), John Ingalls, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06098 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Ingalls Action"") and Michael Riss, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01241 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Riss Action"", collectively with the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action, the MaManus Action and the Ingalls Action, the ""Federal Merger Litigation"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of November 19, 2010, as amended, and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. Each of the Federal Merger Litigation further alleges that (i) the Partnership's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2019 (the ""proxy statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. The Federal Merger Litigation seeks various remedies, including, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed, an order directing that the Board disseminates a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, an order directing defendants to account for all damages sustained, and an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Partnership believes that the claims asserted in the Federal Merger Litigation are without merit and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Federal Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Partnership has determined to voluntarily supplement the proxy statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Partnership specifically denies all allegations in the Federal Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On June 28, 2019, a purported unitholder of Buckeye filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Michael Riss, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01241 (the ""Riss Action"" and, together with the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action, the McManus Action and the Ingalls Action, the ""Federal Merger Litigation""). On June 28, 2019, Buckeye also received a joint demand letter from the plaintiffs of each of the Curtis Action, the Kent Action and the Greer Action reiterating the claims contained in each of those actions. On July 18, 2019, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the McManus Action and the Ingalls Action were transferred to the United States District Court for Southern District of Texas, Houston. These cases are now docketed as Case No. 4:19-cv-02648, 4:19-cv-02647, 4:19-cv-02644 and 4:19-cv-02645, respectively.

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the Merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to Buckeye's limited partnership agreement and its fiduciary duties to Buckeye's unitholders in agreeing to enter into the Merger Agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. The Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action and the McManus Action each further alleges that (i) Buckeye's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the Merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that Buckeye and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of Buckeye, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Preliminary Proxy Statement.

The Ingalls Action and the Riss Action each alleges that (i) Buckeye's definitive proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 25, 2019 (the ""Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the Merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that Buckeye and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of Buckeye, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement.

2019-07-22 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805022/000119312519199048/d778989d8k.htm]:
Item 8.01. | Other Events.

On May 10, 2019, Buckeye Partners, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Buckeye""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Hercules Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), Hercules Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (""ServiceCo""), and Buckeye GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the ""General Partner""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (the ""merger""), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Parent.

Since the May 10, 2019 announcement of the merger agreement, six putative class action complaints and two individual complaints have been filed against Buckeye and the members of the board of directors of the General Partner (the ""Board""). The eight complaints are captioned as follows: Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (filed on June 13, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the ""Curtis Action""), Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128 (filed on June 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Kent Action""), John Greer v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (filed on June 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Greer Action""), Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (filed on June 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Luers Action""), Michael Weston, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01208 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Weston Action""), Heather McManus, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06000 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""McManus Action""), John Ingalls, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06098 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Ingalls Action"") and Michael Riss, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01241 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Riss Action"", collectively with the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action, the MaManus Action and the Ingalls Action, the ""Federal Merger Litigation"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of November 19, 2010, as amended, and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. Each of the Federal Merger Litigation further alleges that (i) the Partnership's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2019 (the ""proxy statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. The Federal Merger Litigation seeks various remedies, including, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed, an order directing that the Board disseminates a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, an order directing defendants to account for all damages sustained, and an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Partnership believes that the claims asserted in the Federal Merger Litigation are without merit and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Federal Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Partnership has determined to voluntarily supplement the proxy statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Partnership specifically denies all allegations in the Federal Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

The Kent Action and the Greer Action each seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), an order directing that the Board disseminates a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Luers Action seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger until disclosure of the allegedly omitted material information identified in the Luers Action is provided, an order rescinding the merger agreement or any of the terms thereof or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Partnership believes that each of the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action and the Luers Action is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The Partnership cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from these matters. It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above may be amended. If this occurs, the Partnership does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint.

On June 14, 2019, the Partnership also received a demand letter from Walter E. Ryan Jr., a purported unitholder of the Partnership, requesting access to certain books and records of the Partnership to investigate possible mismanagement and/or breaches of fiduciary duty by the Board in connection with the merger (the ""Ryan Demand Letter""). On June 21, 2019, the Partnership responded to the Ryan Demand Letter denying the requests and allegations contained therein.

Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (the ""Curtis Action""). On June 18, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v.

Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (the ""Greer Action""). On June 20, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (the ""Luers Action"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As described in the Proxy Statement, on June 19, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Keith v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that our Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed HPE transaction by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al., Case No. 19-2-05756-31 (the ""Delman Complaint""). Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 10, 2019, another similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Rapacki v. Cray, et al., Case No. 19-2-18093-5 SEA (the ""Rapacki Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint and the Delman Complaint, the ""State Court Actions"").

In addition, as described in the Proxy Statement, on June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA (the ""Stein Complaint"" and together with the Davie Complaint and Kent Complaint, the ""Delaware Complaints""). Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 2, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Epstein v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. Case No. 2:19-cv-01026-BJR (the ""Epstein Complaint"" and together with the Delaware Complaints, the ""Federal Court Actions""). The Federal Court Actions each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

The State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

We believe that the claims asserted in the State Court Actions and Federal Court Actions are without merit and deny the allegations in each of those actions. However, in light of the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and to furnish further information to shareholders, we are providing certain additional disclosures (""Supplemental Disclosures"") in this supplement to the Proxy Statement. Counsel for plaintiffs in each of the pending actions described above have confirmed that the Supplemental Disclosures will moot their claims and that they will accordingly dismiss those actions with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs, and without prejudice as to other shareholders. The Supplemental Disclosures should not be regarded as an indication that Cray, HPE or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any recipient of this information, considered or now considers the information contained in the Supplemental Disclosures to be material; rather, we believe that the Proxy Statement disclosed all necessary information and deny that any additional disclosures are or were required under any federal or state law.

The Federal Court Actions each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

The State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the Merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. The probable outcome of the State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend those actions. As a result, the Company considers the likelihood of a material loss related to these matters to be remote.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I found several mentions of ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" in the filing excerpts, which suggests that the case is a class action.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Upon closer examination, I found that the case of interest, Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA, is indeed referred to as a ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" in the filing excerpts. This confirms that the case is a class action.

Since the case is confirmed to be a class action by the keyword search, I will output ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" and provide the sentence containing ""class action"" as ""quote"".

Here is the output in JSON format:
