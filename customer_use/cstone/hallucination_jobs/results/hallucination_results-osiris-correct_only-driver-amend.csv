**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Article V, Section 2 states that ""any alteration, amendment or repeal of Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII shall require the affirmative vote of (a) a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock while the Corporation is under Founder Control and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock from and after the time that the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control.""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment varies depending on the circumstances. While the Corporation is under Founder Control, a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required. After the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control, at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the required percentage is a supermajority in some cases. Specifically, after the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control, at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock is required, which is a supermajority.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. Specifically, the supermajority requirement applies to Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.

Note that the answer to Q2 is not a single number, as the required percentage varies depending on the circumstances.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step based on the task instructions and excerpts provided.

1. **Q1: Supermajority Provision** 
   - The LLM correctly identifies that there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote for amendments to certain articles of the Certificate of Incorporation. It states this requirement: ""any alteration, amendment or repeal of Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII shall require the affirmative vote of... at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Voting Stock from and after the time that the Corporation ceases to be under Founder Control.""

2. **Q2: Percentage Required**
   - The LLM's response includes ambiguity by specifying a conditional percentage (""50"" or ""66.67""), which is incomplete. The correct interpretation should be that a majority is required under Founder Control, and 66 and two-thirds percent (66.67%) is required after Founder Control ceases.

3. **Q3: Supermajority Definition**
   - The response indicates a supermajority is required after Founder Control ceases, which is accurate as the percentage exceeds 50%.

4. **Q4: Subset of Articles**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement applies to a specific subset of articles: V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.

**Analysis of Misinterpretations:**
- The LLM may create confusion for Q2 due to its undecided notation for the percentage required (""50"" or ""66.67"") without a clarifying context. However, this does not fundamentally contradict the documentation excerpts but rather reflects incomplete clarity in its extractive response.

**Conclusion:**
Except for slight ambiguity in Q2, the LLM fundamentally aligns its findings with the document excerpts, capturing the necessary provisions regarding supermajority voting and their applicable contexts. However, this ambiguity can mislead interpretations.

Step 2: Analyze the Question 2 Response
The instruction asks for the percentage if a supermajority is required. The LLM identifies the required percentage as 66-2/3%, which is correct.

Step 3: Analyze the Question 3 Response

Step 4: Analyze Any Additional Responses
The LLM further noted that the percentage specified constitutes a supermajority, which is an accurate interpretation of the given text.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the stockholders, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), by the By-Laws or pursuant to applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any provision of Article I, Article II or Article IV of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith and, with respect to any other provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

Section 8.1. Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(G) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article X shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable law.

Section 12.1. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation (a) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, as to any action in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim (a) as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c) arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a ""foreign action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an ""enforcement action""); and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required by law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII and this Article XIII. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence and the remainder of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"" for certain sections (Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII, and Article XIII), and ""50"" for other sections.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66.67% requirement, and ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement of 66.67% applies to Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article XII, and Article XIII. Additionally, Article X requires a supermajority of 80%.

Note that I've shortened the quote to focus on the relevant provision, and I've included both supermajority requirements in the Q4 answer.",,TRUE,hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step:

1. **Q1: Is there a provision requiring a supermajority to amend the Certificate?**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the Certificate of Incorporation requires a supermajority (66.67%) to amend Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XII, and XIII, as mentioned in Section 13.1 of the excerpts.
   - However, the LLM also mentions Article X requiring an 80% supermajority, which is only partially accurate. The Certificate states that any alteration to Article X requires an 80% supermajority, but the original task did not ask for this in any specific question, it only asked generally for supermajority requirements related to amendments.

2. **Q2: If yes, what percentage?**
   - The LLM correctly states the percentage as 66.67% for the specific articles mentioned. The response of 50% for other sections is implicit in the document. However, the task didn't require 50% as an answer since it mainly focused on supermajority, and 50% is not.

3. **Misinterpretations or Contradictions:**
   - The LLM mistakenly includes ""Article X requires a supermajority of 80%"" in the answer to Q4, which might be confusing without a prompt directly asking about each separate article's requirements or unless these questions addressed other modifications not elucidated by the task.
   - The task is only concerned with whether any supermajority requirement exists for amendments and does not require the LLM to list every instance. Including Article X can be seen as an overstep of the provided task as it wasn't directly asked for in preview questions.
   
4. **Overall Analysis:**
   - The response is largely accurate in identifying the supermajority requirements of 66.67% for certain articles, but it confuses the scope of the task instructions by including details about Article X which did not appear necessary within the scope provided.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - A small hallucination occurred regarding the unnecessary inclusion about specifics requiring more than the supermajority general asked. While it's important to be accurate, precision in addressing the scope exactly asked was slightly mismanaged by providing extra information about amendments. However, the main questioning component was handled suitably about supermajority existence where it matters, even though extra information got slightly included beyond necessary.

"Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

2 | This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the corporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

3 | The certificate of incorporation of the corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

2 | Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election and removal of directors and for all other purposes, and each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock which is outstanding in his, her or its name on the books of the Corporation on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Certificate of Incorporation"") to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Seventh: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. No repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall apply to or have any adverse effect on any right or protection of, or any limitation of the liability of, a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article ELEVENTH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation, or in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any provision (other than such article or section as renumbered, or this sentence), in each case, of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, and this sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

Twelfth: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend and repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the Bylaws may also be amended, altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.

1 | Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article THIRTEENTH.

IN WI'INESS WHEREOF, the undersigned bas executed this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of this 29 day of September, 2020.

Fourth: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 2,275,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 2,250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The excerpt states: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

This indicates that a vote of the stockholders is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The excerpt states: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

This indicates that a majority (50%) of the voting power is required for the amendment. However, there is an additional provision that requires a higher percentage for certain articles: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH...""

Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""50"" for general amendments, but ""66.67"" for amendments to certain articles.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Since the percentage required for general amendments is 50%, which is not a supermajority, the answer to Q3 is ""No"" for general amendments. However, for amendments to certain articles, the percentage required is 66.67%, which is a supermajority. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is ""Yes"" for amendments to certain articles.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The excerpt states: ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, Article FIFTEENTH...""

This indicates that the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, and Article FIFTEENTH.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"To determine whether the LLM made a hallucination, I will carefully analyze its response and the provided excerpts.

Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate?**

   The LLM correctly identifies that there is a provision for a supermajority requirement. The excerpts specifically mention: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal...,"" which clearly constitutes a supermajority requirement. The LLM's answer of ""Yes"" is correct for this question.

2. **Q2: If yes, what percentage?**

   In its detailed analysis, the LLM correctly identifies that a supermajority of 66 2/3% is required for certain articles, which matches the information found in the excerpt. Therefore, the LLM accurately provided ""66.67%"" as the supermajority percentage for certain amendments, aligning with the use of two-thirds majority.

3. **Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (> 50%)?**

   The LLM correctly identifies that for general amendments, only a majority (50%) is required (which is not a supermajority), but for certain articles, a supermajority of 66.67% is required. It accurately reflects this distinction in its response, as indicated by the excerpt detailing that specific articles require the higher voting threshold.

4. **Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

   The LLM provides detailed listing of the specific articles for which the supermajority requirement applies: Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH, Article TWELFTH, Article THIRTEENTH, Article FOURTEENTH, and Article FIFTEENTH. This matches the structuring found in the provided passage where those articles are indeed specified to require a supermajority vote for amendments.

Analysis
The LLM correctly matches each finding with the text and answers as per the original task instructions. It correctly distinguishes between different amendment requirements for certain articles. Importantly, it identifies both the general voting requirement and distinguishes the higher requirement where applicable.

A. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, at any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees (each as defined in that certain Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2020, by and among the Corporation, the Sellers, Polaris Investment Holdings, L.P., Churchill Sponsor III LLC (""Churchill""), and any other parties thereto from time to time (as the same may be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""Investor Rights Agreement"")) beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, in addition to any vote required by applicable law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: this Article V, Article VI, Article IX.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Article XI(A)(1) shall not apply to any action or proceeding asserting a claim under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") or the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the stockholders, at any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), by the Bylaws or by applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to amend, alter, rescind, change, add or repeal, in whole or in part, any provision of the Bylaws or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith; provided, however, that no Bylaw hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors that was valid at the time of such act prior to the adoption of such Bylaw.

6 | The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock).

A. At any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate, 50% or more of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. At any time when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 50% of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders; provided, however, that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable certificate of designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement or any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the total number of directors shall be determined from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors; provided that any determination by the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the total number of directors shall require the approval of 66 2/3% of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors. Class I directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, Class II directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 and Class III directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. Commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, the directors of the class to be elected at each annual meeting shall be elected for a three year term. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to their respective class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article V, Section A: ""the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class: this Article V, Article VI, Article IX.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Articles V, VI, IX"". The excerpt specifically states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments, alterations, repeals, or rescissions of Articles V, VI, and IX.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Analyze Question 1 and Relevant Excerpts
The LLM correctly identifies that there is a provision requiring a supermajority to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation. The excerpt from Article V, Section A, states that an affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power is required to amend Articles V, VI, and IX. This matches the task's definition of a supermajority requirement. Thus, the response to Q1 is accurate.

Step 2: Analyze Question 2 and Relevant Excerpts
For Q2, the LLM correctly identifies the percentage required as 66.67%. The phrase ""66 2/3% in voting power"" from the document supports the provided answer of 66.67%, rounded from the actual figure of 66.6666%. This accurately reflects the percentage specified in the excerpts.

Step 3: Analyze Question 3 and Supermajority Definition
The LLM's response to Q3 is correct; it identifies 66.67% as a supermajority requirement since it exceeds 50% of the voting power, which is the given threshold for a supermajority.

Step 4: Analyze Question 4 and Subset of Articles
The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement applies only to a subset of articles: Articles V, VI, and IX. This is explicitly specified in the given excerpts.

Step 5: Verification of No Hallucination
No hallucination is detected in the LLM's response. The answers align accurately with the contents of the excerpts provided, reflecting the requirements for amending the Certificate of Incorporation and specifying the relevant provisions.

Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation (as defined below)) that relates solely to the rights, powers, preferences (or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof) or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series, by adopting a resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of the shares thereof and by filing a certificate of designation relating thereto in accordance with the DGCL (a ""Certificate of Designation""), to determine and fix the number of shares of such series and such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, and to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series as shall be stated and expressed in such resolutions, all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the creation and issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to any other series of Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation).

The initial Class I directors shall serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the initial Class II directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the initial Class III directors shall serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders following the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, subject to the Stockholders Agreement (as defined below) and the special rights of the holders of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of the stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to Class I, Class II and Class III.

B. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors.

E. Whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, the number of directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to paragraph B of this Article V, and the total number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation(s) in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such Certificate of Designation(s), the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced accordingly.

F. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the ""Bylaws""). In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 and 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors.

No director of the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII, or the adoption of any provision of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VII, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the bylaws of the Corporation or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article IX, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

A.

B.

A. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and shall not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM made any hallucination in its response by comparing its answers against the given excerpts and task instructions.

1. **Question 1: Vote of Shareholders Required to Amend Charter**
   - The LLM states ""Yes"", indicating that a supermajority is required. The provided excerpt supports this with the provision in Article X.A, which specifies: ""the following provisions... may be amended... only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (66 and 2/3%)...""
   - The LLM's response to Question 1 matches the excerpt correctly, so there's no hallucination on this part.

2. **Question 2: Percentage Required**
   - The LLM accurately states the required percentage as ""66.67%"" based on the clause requiring a ""two-thirds (66 and 2/3%)"" vote, which is mathematically equivalent to 66.67%.
   - This is correct according to the excerpt, so there's no hallucination here either.

3. **Question 3: Is the Percentage a Supermajority?**
   - The LLM answers ""Yes"" since 66.67% is indeed a supermajority (>50%).
   - Based on common definitions and task instructions, this aligns correctly and therefore isn't a hallucination.

4. **Question 4: Supermajority for Subset of Articles**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement only applies to specific articles as listed: ""Part B of Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, and Article X.""
   - The information is accurate as per the excerpts, hence the LLM's response is valid.

5. **Quote Provided**

The excerpt contains several articles and sections, but the relevant provisions for the questions are:

* Article XIII(A): This article states that certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, repealed, or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.

Answer: Yes

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Answer: 66.67

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"To determine whether the LLM's response contains any hallucinations, we need to compare its answer with the provided excerpts and the original task instructions.

**Step 1: Verify the Requirement of a Supermajority Vote**

According to the task instructions and provided excerpts, the relevant provision for supermajority requirement is found in Article XIII(A) of the Certificate of Incorporation. The LLM correctly identified this provision, which states that certain amendments require ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.""

- **LLM Conclusion for Q1**: The response indicates that a supermajority is required.
- **Comparison with Excerpt**: This is accurate as the excerpt explicitly states the need for a two-thirds (66.67%) majority for certain amendments.

**Step 2: Identify the Supermajority Percentage**

The task instructions seek specific confirmation of the percentage required if a supermajority is necessary.

- **LLM Conclusion for Q2**: The LLM stated 66.67% as the requirement.
- **Comparison with Excerpt**: This is correct according to the text that specifies a 66 2/3% affirmative vote.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Scope of the Supermajority Requirement**

The task asks if the supermajority requirement applies only to a subset of articles.

- **LLM Conclusion for Q4**: The LLM states that the requirement applies only to a subset of articles, specifically Articles V(B), VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII.
- **Comparison with Excerpt**: This matches the excerpt, which lists these specific articles as subject to the supermajority requirement.

**Analysis of Incorrect Question Responses**

The LLM response included answers to questions that were not a part of the original task instructions (e.g., Q3 and Q4). These portions of its output perhaps originate from a misinterpretation or incorrectly reformulated task but do not reflect divergence directly recognized in the current task's explicit directions.

**Conclusion**

The LLM correctly followed the instructions for Q1 and Q2 based on the excerpts, thus appropriately answering the task's queries relevant to supermajority requirements. However, the inclusion of Q3 and Q4 may imply formatting error but not hallucination under the context of the first two queries also explicitly specified in the task instructions.

Section 4.1 Authorized Capital Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share, which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 271,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 270,000,000 shares of common stock (the ""Common Stock""), including (i) 220,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (the ""Class A Common Stock""), and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of Class B common stock (the ""Class B Common Stock""), and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the ""Preferred Stock"" and, collectively with Common Stock, ""Stock"").

Except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of the Class A Common Stock and holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to vote on all matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or other series of Common Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

(i) Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), for so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock shall remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or special rights of the Class B Common Stock.

B. | Following the surrender of any shares of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation in accordance with this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation will take all actions necessary to retire such shares and such shares shall not be re-issued by the Corporation.

Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(d) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective. In no event shall the shares of either Class B Common Stock be split, subdivided, or combined (including by way of stock dividend) unless the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock shall be proportionately split, subdivided or combined.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

Any promissory note shall contain such terms and conditions as the Corporation determines necessary or advisable, including without limitation, prepayment at the maker's option at any time without premium or penalty or subordination provisions.

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights reserved in this Article XI.

[Signature Page to Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there is a provision in Article XI that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Specifically, it states that ""any alteration, amendment or repeal of this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate shall require the affirmative vote of (a) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Stock while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock and (b) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock.""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is 50% while Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock, and 66.67% from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta (together with the Fertitta Affiliates) no longer beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of the Stock.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentage required for the amendment is a supermajority, specifically 66.67%, which is greater than 50%.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

The supermajority requirement is not only applied for a subset of articles, but it is also applied to the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, with certain exceptions. However, there is a specific provision that requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of each class of Common Stock, voting separately as a class, whose relative rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions are adversely affected.

Note that the quote is shortened to focus on the relevant provision.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM response step by step in the context of the task instructions and provided excerpts:

**Q1: Supermajority Provision**  
The LLM correctly identified that a provision exists concerning stockholders' voting power to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. It pointed out that a supermajority is required, specifically ""at least two-thirds of the voting power"" once Mr. Fertitta no longer holds the majority, which is in line with the usual definition of a supermajority.

**Q2: Percentage Required**  
The LLM accurately stated the percentages: 50% when Mr. Fertitta holds the majority and 66.67% when he does not, reflecting what's in the excerpts.

**Q3: Supermajority Indication**  
The LLM correctly stated that the 66.67% requirement is a supermajority, as it exceeds 50%.

**Q4: Subset of Articles**  
The LLM said that the supermajority requirement applies to the entire Certificate of Incorporation, although other provisions apply to specific rights, which aligns with the extracted text.

**Analysis Summary**  
The LLM accurately extracted and interpreted the excerpt content. The cited quote explains the basis for requiring a supermajority vote. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences from task instructions. The LLM response aligns well with the task's questions and context.

**Final Determination**: No hallucination in the LLM's response.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been signed this __29__ day of _December___, 2020.

Section 4.2 Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby authorized to provide from time to time by resolution or resolutions for the creation and issuance, out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock by filing a certificate (a ""Certificate of Designation"") pursuant to the DGCL, setting forth such resolution and, with respect to each such series, establishing the designation of such series and the number of shares to be included in such series and fixing the voting powers (full or limited, or no voting power), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of each such series. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock may, to the extent permitted by law, provide that such series shall be superior to, rank equally with or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may be different from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock, no vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in accordance with this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), the holders of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation. The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote. The holders of shares of the Common Stock shall at all times vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.

(b) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (or any Certificate of Designation made hereunder) or the DGCL.

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; provided that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.1 To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended, automatically and without further action, upon the date of such amendment.

Section 7.4 Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption by amendment of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of any provision inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise) prior to such amendment or repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no amendment or repeal of this Section 7.5 in accordance with the provisions hereof shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any Exempted Person for or with respect to any activities or opportunities of which such Exempted Person becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal. This Section 7.5 shall not limit or eliminate any protections or defenses otherwise available to, or any rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, any agreement between the Corporation and such officer or director, or any applicable law.

Section 8.1 Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided that, the provisions of this Article VIII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction; and provided further that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VIII. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article VIII. If any provision or provisions of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and this Article IX.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and this Article IX."" (Section 9) and also ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class; provided that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted."" (Section 4.3(a))

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer to Q2 is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock is required.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer to Q3 is ""Yes"". The percentage required is 66.67%, which is greater than 50%.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer to Q4 is ""Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock is required to alter, amend or repeal these specific articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Analyze the Excerpts for Q1 and Q2

The task requires identifying if the Certificate of Incorporation has a provision for a supermajority vote to amend the Charter. The supermajority is usually more than a simple majority, specifically mentioned as percentages like 66-2/3%, 75%, etc.

Upon reviewing the excerpts, it is evident that the Certificate does contain such a provision. Section 9 of the excerpt specifies that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and this Article IX."" Therefore, the LLM's answer to Q1 is ""Yes"", which is correct.

Regarding Q2, the task asks what percentage is required if Q1 is ""Yes"". The excerpt clearly states ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%)"", which translates to 66.67%. The LLM correctly cited this percentage for Q2.

Step 2: Analyze the Excerpts for Q3 and Q4

For Q3, it asks whether the percentage is a supermajority. This requires simple confirmation that the percentage (66.67%) is indeed greater than 50%, which is true.

For Q4, the LLM needs to identify whether this supermajority only applies to a subset of articles. It refers specifically to Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX in the provided excerpt. The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement is directed specifically at altering these articles.

Conclusion

The LLM response accurately understood the excerpts and relevant provisions in the Certification of Incorporation. The analysis aligns with the instructions and correctly applied them to answer the questions posed. Therefore, no hallucination occurred.

Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL, the text of the Certificate of Incorporation of Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp. is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Section 2. Preferred Stock. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board is hereby authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, without approval of the stockholders of the Corporation (except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Delaware (hereinafter referred to as a ""Preferred Stock Designation""), to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designations, powers (including voting powers, if any), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the shares of each such series, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, if any, including but not limited to the fixing or alteration of the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), the redemption price or prices, and the liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series or shares of Preferred Stock.

The Corporation shall, from time to time and in accordance with applicable law, increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock remaining unissued and available for issuance shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of any series of Preferred Stock that, as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV, Section 2, is otherwise convertible into Common Stock.

(a) Voting: Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or the relevant Preferred Stock Designation of any class or series of Preferred Stock or required by law, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.

Except as otherwise required by law, shares of Common Stock shall not entitle the holders thereof to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including to a Preferred Stock Designation) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of solely one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote on such amendment pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including a Preferred Stock Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL, or if no vote of stockholders is required pursuant to the DGCL.

(g) In addition to the powers and authority herein or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted shall invalidate any prior act of the directors that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 6. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 9. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The rights provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such person's heirs, executors and administrators.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article IX, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation becomes or is declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and the court will replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with a valid and enforceable provision that most accurately reflects the Corporation's intent, in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, void or unenforceable provision. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the balance of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been signed this 21st day of January, 2021.

At any time when any shares of capital stock of the Company are outstanding, the Company shall not, either directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate with or into another entity if, as a result of such merger or consolidation, the capital stock of the Company would become, or be converted into or exchanged for the right to receive, shares or other equity interests in a domestic or foreign corporation that is not a public benefit corporation or similar entity and the certificate of incorporation (or similar governing document) of which does not contain identical provisions to Article III identifying the public benefit or public benefits, unless the Company shall have obtained, in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or as required by applicable law, each holder of record of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Class V Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally or holders of Class V Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote (whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); provided, however, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, holders of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or other series of Common Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

If the Corporation at any time combines or subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation, scheme, arrangement or otherwise (each, a ""Split"")) any class of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, the shares of each other class of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately similarly combined or subdivided such that the ratio of shares of outstanding Class B Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, respectively, to shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such subdivision shall be maintained immediately after such combination or subdivision; provided, that such actions with respect to the Class V Common Stock shall be subject to Section 4.1(d) and the last sentence of Section 3.1 of the LLC Agreement. Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(G) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective.

Section 8.1. Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(G) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a ""foreign action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an ""enforcement action""); and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

Section 13.1. Amendments.

Note that I've only included one quote that supports the answers, but there are multiple provisions in the excerpt that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response, based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts. 

Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Task and Excerpts**:
   - **Q1** concerns whether a supermajority is required to amend parts of the Certificate of Incorporation. The LLM correctly identifies the need for a supermajority as the excerpts specify a 66 2/3% vote requirement for altering certain Articles (V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XII, and XIII).
   - **Q2** requires specifying the percentage. The LLM provided 66.67% and correctly noted the separate supermajority requirement of 80% for Article X.
   
2. **Misinterpretations**:
   - The LLM's response initially appears to conflate the interpretation by including only a single percentage (66.67%) under question 2, even though it later addresses the 80% for Article X in its analysis, which could confuse the task's flow concerning the exact requirement for different articles.
   - Additionally, in the final JSON response, the LLM doesn't include mention of the 80% required for Article X, which was part of the extracted requirement.

3. **Divergence from Task**:
   - The LLM should have clearly segmented the requirement for the 80% in its JSON object, as instructed, since it pertains to a different subset.
   - There appears to be a slight misunderstanding in addressing Q3 concerning supermajority percentages, which should also have been captured separately in the output, emphasizing that a supermajority is required in specific articles.

4. **Final Numerical Details**:
   - While the LLM correctly addresses the supermajority requirement, its JSON does not clearly split between different Article requirements in terms of percentages, making it not entirely clear and potentially misleading.

Conclusion:
- The LLM has correctly identified and interpreted the excerpts regarding the supermajority requirements but could improve clarity in presentation and adherence to questions by better distinguishing between differing supermajority percentages in its summary JSON response.

6.1 Merger or Consolidation.

6.2 Third-Party Tender or Exchange Offers. The Corporation may not enter into any agreement pursuant to which a third party may by tender or exchange offer acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock unless the holders of (a) the Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class B Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive, and (b) the Class B Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class A Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in connection with such tender or exchange offer in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of the holders of shares of the Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities exchangeable for each share of Class B Common Stock having twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities exchangeable for each share of Class A Common Stock or any other share of stock then outstanding) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

9. Protective Provisions.

Signature Page to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 628,000,000 shares, consisting of 600,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class A Common Stock""), 27,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class B Common Stock""), and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the number of shares thereof then outstanding and (ii) with respect to the Class A Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock reserved pursuant to Section 8 of Part A of this Article IV) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there is a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. The relevant provision is in Article V, which states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent therewith.""

Additionally, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, such as in Article 9, which states that ""the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation...""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. This is equivalent to 50%.

However, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, which is two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

No, the general provision requires a majority vote, which is not a supermajority. However, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, which is two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically those that relate to the rights, powers, and privileges of the holders of Class B Common Stock. The relevant provisions are in Article 9, which states that the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that is inconsistent with, or that otherwise alters or changes, any of the voting, conversion, dividend or liquidation provisions of the shares of Class B Common Stock.

Note that the Q4 answer is not a direct quote from the excerpt, but rather a summary of the relevant provisions.",,TRUE,hallucination,"To analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination, we need to examine if its response correctly interprets the excerpts and adheres to the task instructions.

1. **Q1 Analysis: Is there a provision for a supermajority?**
   - **Excerpts Review**: The provision requiring ""the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock... voting together as a single class"" is not indicative of a supermajority vote. The specified ""majority of the voting power"" usually means a simple majority (50%), not a supermajority (more than 50%).
   - **LLM Response**: The LLM asserts ""Yes"" for supermajority vote requirement but simultaneously references a 50% majority, creating a contradiction. The supermajority aspect should hinge on the two-thirds requirement for the Class B Common Stock discussed later, not the general provision.

2. **Q2 Analysis: What percentage is required if supermajority is applicable?**
   - **Excerpts Review**: The general voting requirement is a majority (50%). However, for Class B Common Stock, a two-thirds (2/3rd) voting requirement is necessary for changes affecting the Class B stock.
   - **LLM Response**: While partially correct in identifying the general 50% for most amendments, the discussion regarding a supermajority should also explicitly highlight the two-thirds requirement for Class B Common Stock, which it did mention separately but the connection was not explicit.

3. **Q3 Analysis: Is this percentage a supermajority?**
   - **LLM Response**: The LLM states ""No"" for the general provision, which is correct as the majority vote is not a supermajority. However, a supermajority is required for amendments pertaining to Class B, which is not clearly tied to the general question here. This separation needs clarification.

4. **Q4 Analysis: Is the supermajority applicable only to a subset of articles?**
   - **Excerpts Review**: Yes, the supermajority requirement is specific to provisions impacting Class B Common Stock.
   - **LLM Response**: The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement is only applicable to articles related to Class B Common Stock.

Overall Analysis:
- **Contradiction**: There is a contradiction in the LLM's handling of the term ""supermajority,"" as it first indicates a supermajority requirement for a majority vote, which is inaccurate. The two-thirds vote applies only to specific provisions concerning Class B stock.
- **Misinterpretation**: The response does not clearly distinguish between the general majority requirement and specific instances where a supermajority applies.
- **Task Adherence**: The answer features both majority and supermajority aspects properly but lacks clarity in when each applies.

4. The text of the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows:

2 | Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time, including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Certificate of Incorporation""), each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock which is outstanding in his, her or its name on the books of the Corporation on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally.

TWELFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), (A) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws and (B) at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

EIGHTH: Unless otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time only by the Secretary at the direction of the Board or by the Chairman of the Board; provided, however, that at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50 % in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes shall also be promptly called by the Secretary or by the Chairman of the Board upon the written request of holders of at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting.

A. Classes of Stock. The total number of shares that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 155,000,000 shares, which shall be divided into two classes of stock to be designated ""Common Stock"" and ""Preferred Stock."" The total number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 150,000,000 shares, $0.0001 par value. The total number of shares of Preferred Stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 5,000,000 shares, $0.0001 par value. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation"" (Article ELEVENTH).

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". However, the excerpt also mentions that at any time when RT beneficially owns collectively, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, an affirmative vote of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required (Article ELEVENTH). Therefore, the percentage required is dependent on the ownership percentage of RT.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt requires a supermajority of 66 2/3% in certain circumstances.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement applies to amendments, alterations, changes, or repeals of certain articles, specifically Article Fifth, Article Sixth, Article Seventh, Article Eighth, Article Ninth, Article Tenth, Article Eleventh, and Article Twelfth, or any successor provision.

Note that the answer to Q2-percentage-required is ""66.67"", but it's worth noting that the excerpt also mentions a majority vote requirement in certain circumstances.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step, based on the instructions and the provided excerpts.

1. **Q1: Supermajority Provision**: The LLM correctly identifies that a supermajority vote is required for amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation. The excerpt explicitly states that ""an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation.""

2. **Q2: Percentage Required**: The LLM states ""66.67"" as the percentage for a supermajority. This is a fair rounding of the 66 2/3%, which equates to 66.67%. The LLM also correctly points out that there is a different requirement when RT owns at least 50%—a majority vote is then sufficient.

3. **Q3: Supermajority for Subset of Articles**: The LLM accurately notes that the supermajority requirement specifically pertains to certain articles, namely Article Fifth, Article Sixth, Article Seventh, Article Eighth, Article Ninth, Article Tenth, Article Eleventh, and Article Twelfth, along with any successor provisions. The excerpt supports this, specifying that these articles have specific supermajority requirements for amendments.

4. Although the response correctly captures the necessary details, it fails to answer specifically at what percentage the supermajority requirement changes based on RT's ownership. Specifically, when RT owns less than 50%, a supermajority is required, but when RT owns more, a simple majority suffices. The LLM mentions this in its explanation but could better clarify it with a numerical value (e.g., ""50%"" for when RT owns over 50%).

**Conclusion**: The LLM correctly identifies and interprets the supermajority provisions in the document, aligning well with the given excerpts. No hallucination occurs, but some clarifications or more explicit detailing could enhance answer precision.

1. **Supermajority Requirement:**
   - The LLM correctly identified that a supermajority requirement exists in the Certificate of Incorporation. The excerpt specifies that an affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power is required to amend certain articles of the Certificate. This matches the definition of a supermajority as per the task instructions.

2. **Percentage Requirement:**
   - The LLM correctly identified the percentage as 66.67%, which aligns with the task's definition of a supermajority.

3. **Application to Subset of Articles:**
   - The LLM correctly noted that the requirement applies only to specific articles: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, and Article XI.

Step 2: Checking for Divergence from Task Instructions

All the answers provided in the response align with the task instructions. The LLM correctly interpreted the given article text and answered the multi-part question based on the provided Certificate of Incorporation excerpt.

Additional Point:

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

1. The name of the Corporation is ""South Mountain Merger Corp."" (the ""Corporation""). The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 28, 2019, and was most recently amended and restated on June 19, 2019 (the ""Existing Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Existing Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

4. The text of the Existing Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

D. Except as otherwise provided herein, the holders of Class 1 Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Class 1 Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation on which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote. Except as required by law or as otherwise set forth herein, the holders of shares of Class 2 Common Stock shall have no voting rights or power and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to law or this Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock). There shall be no cumulative voting and no shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. The number of authorized shares of Class 1 Common Stock and/or Class 2 Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by (in addition to any vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock that may be required) the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

H. The Corporation shall at all times when the Class 2 Common Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Class 2 Common Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Class 1 Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Class 2 Common Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class 1 Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Class 2 Common Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class 1 Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.

I. Except as expressly provided in Section D of this Article IV above with respect to (i) voting powers and (ii) the Share Distributions (as hereinafter defined), the Class 1 Common Stock and the Class 2 Common Stock shall be identical in all respects and shall be pari passu with one another, and share ratably on a per share basis in respect of, the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation made in respect of the Common Stock. The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, declare a dividend of any securities of the Corporation or of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other legal entity (a ""Share Distribution"") to the holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock (i) on the basis of a ratable distribution of identical securities to holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock or (ii) on the basis of a ratable distribution of one class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock and another class or series of securities to holders of Class 2 Common Stock; provided that the securities so distributed (and, if the distribution consists of convertible or exchangeable securities, the securities into which such convertible or exchangeable securities are convertible or for which they are exchangeable) do not differ in any respect other than (x) differences in their rights (other than voting rights and powers) consistent in all material respects with differences between Class 1 Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock and (y) differences in their relative voting rights and powers, with holders of shares of Class 2 Common Stock receiving a class or series of such securities having no voting rights or powers and holders of shares of Class 1 Common Stock receiving a class or series of such securities having voting rights or powers (without regard to whether such voting rights or powers are greater or lesser than the voting rights or powers of the Class 1 Common Stock provided in this Restated Charter). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, amendment to this Certificate, operation of law or otherwise, effect any stock split, recapitalization or similar adjustment to either class of its Common Stock unless simultaneously in connection therewith the Corporation effects an identical stock split, recapitalization or similar adjustment to the other classes of its Common Stock.

A. The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In furtherance thereof, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing two sentences shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

C. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any Specified Party granted pursuant hereto existing at, or arising out of or related to any event, act or omission that occurred prior to, the time of such amendment, repeal, adoption or modification. This Article VII shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Corporation; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee, or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action, governed by the internal-affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section A of Article VIII shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act""), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

B. Subject to Sections A and C of Article VI and to the rights of any holders of any shares of Preferred Stock which may from time to time come into existence and be outstanding, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal, at any time and from time to time, any provision contained in this Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in Section C of this Article IX, and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon the stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended herein are granted subject to this reservation.

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662∕3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX.

The Board of Directors is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend or repeal any provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662∕3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

J. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any of the remaining shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares of such series and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors and filed in accordance with the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Section C of Article IX, which states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Section C of Article IX.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

However, it is also stated that for amendments to Article V, Section 1, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII, a two-thirds (2/3) vote is required. Therefore, the LLM correctly identified that a supermajority is required for certain amendments, but the labeling as a simple ""Yes"" is misleading without further clarification that it is not a blanket requirement across all articles.

2. **Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage required?**
   - **LLM Response:** 50%.
   - **Analysis:** This part of the response is inaccurate because the provision for the majority (50%) is only applicable when an amendment or repeal is not otherwise specified. However, for certain documents (notably Articles V, VI, and VII), a two-thirds majority is indeed required. Therefore, the answer should have included a dual percentage of ""50% and 66.67% for certain amendments"" to accurately represent the provided information.

3. **Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e., > 50%)?**
   - **LLM Response:** Yes for certain amendments, No for others.
   - **Analysis:** This statement is correct because specific sections (Articles V, VI, and VII) require a two-thirds vote, which is indeed a supermajority.

4. **Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**
   - **LLM Response:** Yes, applies to Article V, Section 1, Article VI, Section 3, Article VII.
   - **Analysis:** The LLM's response aligns with the information in the excerpt, which specifies those exact sections that require a supermajority vote. 

5. **Conclusion and JSON generation:**
   - The LLM's response contains partial hallucination by omitting necessary information in Q2 regarding multiple percentage requirements, which results in an incomplete representation of the full amendment requirements, and clarifies in Q1 that it is not a universal supermajority requirement, just for certain articles.
   - The overall structure and recognition of certain articles needing a supermajority are correct, but crucial numerical details were missing in the submitted JSON.

"(5) In addition to any other vote required in this Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall each be entitled to vote separately as a class only with respect to amendments to this Certificate of Incorporation that increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such class so as to affect them adversely.

(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(1) Subject to any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held by them, such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the board of directors of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor. Except as provided in Clause (B)(iv) of this Article FOURTH, dividends and other distributions shall not be declared or paid on the Class B Common Stock.

(2) Subject to any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of Class C Common Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, the dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation payable or to be made on outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock that would have been payable on the shares of Class C Common Stock if each such share of Class C Common Stock had been converted into a fraction of a share of Class A Common Stock equal to the Conversion Ratio immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution. The holders of shares of Class C Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis with the holders of the Class A Common Stock, such dividend or other distribution on the Class A Common Stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor.

(ix) Company Conversion of Class B Common Stock. Immediately and automatically upon the earlier of (the ""Effective Time"") (1) July 4, 2024 and (2) the date on which there are no amounts owed to any lender pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated as of July 3, 2018, among DMSH, Digital Media Solutions, LLC (""DMS""), each of the affiliates of DMS party thereto as borrowers, each of the guarantors party thereto, each of the lenders thereunder, the other financial institutions party thereto and Monroe Capital Management Advisors LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), each share of Class B Common Stock (the ""Old Class B Common Stock"") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed, pursuant to a reverse stock split (the ""Reverse Split""), into a fraction of a share of the Corporation's outstanding Class B Common Stock equal to the Conversion Ratio (the ""New Class B Common Stock""), subject to the treatment of fractional interests as described below. Each holder, if any, of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Old Class B Common Stock (the ""Old Certificates""), shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of such Old Certificates to the Corporation's transfer agent for cancellation, a certificate or certificates (the ""New Certificates"") (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) representing the number of whole shares of the New Class B Common Stock into and for which the shares of the Old Class B Common Stock formerly represented by such Old Certificates so surrendered are reclassified under the terms hereof. From and after the Effective Time, the Old Certificates shall thereupon be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of New Class B Common Stock in the appropriately reduced whole number of shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional interests in New Class B Common Stock will be issued, and no such fractional interest will entitle the holder thereof to vote, or to any rights of a stockholder of the Corporation. In lieu of any fraction of a share of New Class B Common Stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled pursuant hereto (taking into account all shares of capital stock owned by such holder), the holder will receive cash, without interest, equal to the fair value of one share of Old Class B Common Stock multiplied by such fraction. If more than one Old Certificate shall be surrendered at one time for the account of the same stockholder, the number of full shares of New Class B Common Stock for which New Certificates (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) shall be issued shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by the Old Certificates so surrendered. In the event that the Corporation's transfer agent determines that a holder of Old Certificates has not surrendered all his, her or its certificates for exchange, the transfer agent shall carry forward any fractional interest until all certificates of that holder have been presented for exchange such that any New Class B Common Stock issued for fractional shares to any one holder shall not exceed the one share. If any New Certificate (or book-entries made in lieu thereof) is to be issued in a name other than that in which it was issued, the Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the stock transfer tax stamps to the Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person or persons requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the Old Certificates surrendered, or provide funds for their purchase, or establish to the satisfaction of the transfer agent that such taxes are not payable. From and after the Effective Time, the amount of capital shall be represented by the shares of the New Class B Common Stock into which and for which the shares of the Old Class B Common Stock are reclassified, until thereafter reduced or increased in accordance with applicable law. All references in this Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, to the ""Class B Common Stock"" shall, after the Effective Time, mean the ""New Class B Common Stock.""

SEVENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a person who serves as a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

C. Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article TENTH shall require the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article TENTH, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article TENTH, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article TENTH in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article TENTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article TENTH shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law.

TWELFTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, and all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TWELFTH; provided, however, that the following provisions may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single class: Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH and TWELFTH; provided, further, that Article TENTH may only be amended as set forth therein; provided, further, that, as long as there are any shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding, the existence of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, and the rights, preferences and privileges conferred upon the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in Article SECOND, including those related to the Redemption Right and the Exchange Option, may not be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any provision inconstant therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the unanimous affirmative vote of all of the holders of the Class B Common Stock.

ELEVENTH: The Bylaws may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, in whole or in part, either (A) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors (subject to any bylaw requiring the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of the members of the Board of Directors) or (B) without the approval of the Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation.

(4) Except as otherwise required in this Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote (or, if any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of Preferred Stock).","Let's break down the excerpt and answer the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The excerpt mentions two different percentages:

* 66-2/3% (Article TWELFTH) for amending certain articles (FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH, and TWELFTH)
* 80% (Article TENTH) for amending Article TENTH
* Unanimous affirmative vote of all holders of Class B Common Stock (Article TWELFTH) for amending certain provisions related to Class B Common Stock

We will use the first percentage mentioned, which is 66-2/3%.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66-2/3% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement of 66-2/3% is applied to a subset of articles, specifically Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH, and TWELFTH.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

```",,TRUE,hallucination,"Step 1: Analysis of Q1 Answer
The task asks whether there is a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate. The LLM concludes ""Yes"", and this is supported by the excerpt from the Certificate that mentions a supermajority requirement of 66-2/3% for certain articles. Thus, there is no hallucination in the LLM's response to Q1.

Step 2: Analysis of Q2 Answer
The task asks for the percentage if the answer to Q1 is ""Yes."" The LLM extracts 66-2/3% as the required percentage for certain articles. This is directly supported by the excerpt mentioning ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%)"" for Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH, ELEVENTH, and TWELFTH. There is no hallucination here.

Step 3: Analysis of Additional Responses
Q3 and Q4 were not part of the original questions in this set of instructions, so their inclusion is a divergence from the task's scope. The LLM was not supposed to generate answers for these questions based on the provided instructions.

Inclusion of New Information: 
While the LLM’s JSON output contains a valid list confirming the supermajority requirement applies to a subset of articles, the output was formatted inappropriately according to the task requirements. The response introduces JSON values and keys not requested, such as ""Q3"" and ""Q4"".

Final Determination
While the information provided about the percentage and the subset of articles was correct, some responses are outside the scope, specifically the introduction of new questions (Q3 and Q4) that were not asked initially in the instructions. This instance reflects a divergence from the explicit task instructions, resulting in incorrect JSON output.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

2 | An amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which amended and restated the Original Certificate in its entirety, was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in July, 2019 (the ""Existing Certificate"").

3 | Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") is being amended and restated in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Corporation, CP II Merger Sub, Inc., Advantage Solutions Inc. and Karman Topco L.P.. dated as of September 7, 2020.

Section 2. Subject to all the rights, powers and preferences of the Preferred Stock and except as provided by law or in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation (as defined below): (i) the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors of the Corporation and on all other matters requiring stockholder action, each outstanding share entitling the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, on such amendment pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL; (ii) dividends may be declared and paid or set apart for payment upon the Common Stock out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, but only when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") or any authorized committee thereof; and (iii) upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock.

Section 3. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board, or any authorized committee thereof, is hereby authorized to provide from time to time by resolution or resolutions for the creation and issuance, out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock by filing a certificate (a ""Certificate of Designation"") pursuant to the DGCL, setting forth such resolution or resolutions and, with respect to each such series, establishing the designation of such series and the number of shares to be included in such series and fixing the terms of such series, the voting powers (full or limited, or no voting power), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of each such series. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the resolution or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred Stock may, to the extent permitted by law, provide that such series shall be superior to, rank equally with or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series. The terms, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of Preferred Stock may be different from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), no vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board may, by resolution or resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution or resolutions originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

Section 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and any special rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the bylaws of the Corporation (as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the ""Bylaws"") or delegated by resolution of the Board, the Board shall have the exclusive power and authority to appoint and remove officers of the Corporation.

Section 2. Other than any directors elected by the separate vote of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, if applicable, the Board shall be and is divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board may assign members of the Board already in office to such classes as of the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Effective Time""). Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board. At the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three years. Subject to any special rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, at each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal from office.

Section 5. During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the special right to elect additional directors, upon commencement and for the duration of such period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of additional directors, and the holders of such series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Designation establishing such series of Preferred Stock; and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the Certificate of Designation establishing such series of Preferred Stock, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Except as otherwise provided by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation establishing any series of Preferred Stock), whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having the special right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including pursuant to any such Certificate of Designation), the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such series, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL (including Section 102(b)(7)), as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VII to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended, automatically and without further action, upon the date of such amendment.

Section 4. Neither any amendment or repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption by amendment of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of any provision inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise) prior to such amendment or repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

Section 1. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or, in the event that the federal district court for the District of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Bylaws or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions of this Article VIII, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

* * * * This Seconded Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is executed on this 28th day of October, 2020.

Section 1. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation (and may not be taken by consent of the stockholders in lieu of a meeting); provided, however, that any action required or permitted to be taken by any holders of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable Certificate of Designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock.","To answer the questions, I will go through them one by one.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Section 1 of Article X, which states: ""Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or classes or series of stock required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation in respect of one or more series of Preferred Stock), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX or this Article X.""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Section 1 of Article X.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

B. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of this corporation and by the stockholders in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

C. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

3.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws"") and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to ten (10) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder.

Section 9. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting conversions of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, such number of duly authorized shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the number of authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, the Corporation shall promptly take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. All shares of Class A Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares. The Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all such shares of Class A Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation.

Section 2. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder in such stockholder's capacity as such arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law, this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article X shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Section 1. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), and subject to Sections 1 and 2.1 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions.

Section 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, Section 3 of Article IV or this Section 2 of Article XII.

The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board shall require the approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock issued pursuant to any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws.

1.2 The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law, and no vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

Yes, there are provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

There are different percentages required for different sections of the Certificate of Incorporation. For the Specified Provisions (Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of Article XII), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required. However, if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required.

For Section 3 of Article IV or Section 2 of Article XII, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Yes, the required percentages are supermajorities.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. For the Specified Provisions (Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of Article XII), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required. For Section 3 of Article IV or Section 2 of Article XII, the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, is required.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Question 1: Vote Requirement for Amendments**
   - **Task Instructions**: Identify if more than a simple majority is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.
   - **Excerpt Analysis**:
     - The excerpt states: 
       > ""...the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power... shall be required to amend or repeal... the Specified Provisions.""
     - This indicates a requirement for a two-thirds supermajority to amend certain parts of the Certificate, which aligns with the task.

2. **Question 2: Percentage Required**
   - **Task Instructions**: Specify the percentage if a supermajority is required.
   - **Excerpt Analysis**:
     - The LLM accurately identifies and presents two-thirds (approximately 66.67%) as the required percentage for the Specified Provisions.

3. **Question 3: Supermajority Requirement**
   - **Task Instructions**: Determine if the identified percentage constitutes a supermajority or not.
   - **Excerpt Analysis**:
     - The requirement of two-thirds and seventy-five percent both exceed a simple majority, confirming these are supermajorities.

4. **Question 4: Subset of Articles**
   - **Task Instructions**: Identify if the supermajority requirement is specific to a subset of articles.
   - **Excerpt Analysis**:
     - Regarding the Specified Provisions, the requirement applies specifically to ""Sections 1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of Article XII"" as identified by the LLM, which seems correctly cited from the document.
     - It is also clear that another supermajority applies to ""Section 3 of Article IV or Section 2 of Article XII"" with a separate 75% requirement for different classes of stock holders, which the LLM correctly identifies.

### Final Determination
- The response accurately mirrors the details in the given excerpts from the Certificate of Incorporation, portraying information regarding required voting supermajorities and relevant articles accurately.
- The JSON response seems structured well according to the task, although only one supermajority condition is responded in detail within the JSON format due to format limitations, which aligns with the task's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The LLM response is accurate, consistent with task instructions, and reflects information presented in the excerpts without any halluciations.

This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock, are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, as they may be further amended from time to time (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III.

Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3. Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(a) The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

(b) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or applicable law.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V.

Section 12.1. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the United States federal securities laws.

The LLM states the supermajority percentage required is 66.67%. This figure is derived from the provided excerpt's mention of 66.7%, a commonly rounded version of 66 2/3 percent, which is equivalent to 66.67%. The rounding is commonly seen, and there is no issue with this rounding.

Analysis: The interpretation of the percentage is logical and mathematically sound. There is no hallucination in this aspect of the response.

Step 3: Supermajority Definition in Question 3

The LLM concludes the percentage required, 66.67%, constitutes a supermajority as it exceeds 50%.

Analysis: This understanding is correct because 66.67% is indeed more than a simple majority (50%).

Step 4: Supermajority Limited to a Subset of Articles in Question 4

The LLM identifies that the supermajority applies only to Article V.

Analysis: The response is backed by the excerpt text that restricts this voting requirement specificity to amendments concerning Article V.

Conclusion: The LLM did not hallucinate in its responses. All aspects of the task were addressed adequately, with evidence drawn from the given excerpt data.

2. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation attached hereto as Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference, and which restates, integrates and further amends the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of this Corporation as heretofore amended and restated, has been duly adopted by the Corporation's Board of Directors and by the stockholders in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

3. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be effective as of 1:02 pm Eastern Time on November 25, 2020.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its duly authorized officer on November 25, 2020 and the foregoing facts stated herein are true and correct.

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

1. Definitions. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate, the following definitions apply:

1.2 ""Amended and Restated Certificate"" means this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation, as defined below), as may be further amended and restated from time to time.

1.16 ""Qualified Stockholder"" means (a) any registered holder of a share of Class B Common Stock as of the Effective Time (as defined under the BCA); (b) any Permitted Transferee; and (c) the initial registered holder of any shares of Class B Common Stock that are originally issued by the Corporation after the Effective Time in compliance with this Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. Identical Rights. Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate or required by applicable law, shares of Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including, without limitation, as to any dividends and distributions, any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and any voting of such shares), share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters.

4.4 Election of Directors. Subject to any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under circumstances specified in this Amended and Restated Certificate (as modified by any Preferred Stock Designation), (i) prior to the Final Conversion Date, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect and remove all directors of the Corporation, and (ii) from and after the Final Conversion Date, if any, the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect and remove all directors of the Corporation.

1. Board Power. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred by statute or by this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

Neither any amendment, repeal nor elimination of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, elimination or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

If any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate becomes or is declared on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Amended and Restated Certificate, and the court will replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate with a valid and enforceable provision that most accurately reflects the Corporation's intent, in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, void or unenforceable provision. The balance of this Amended and Restated Certificate shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

Except as provided in Article IX above, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate, from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with, Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article X.

2. Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. The Bylaws of the Corporation may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

2. Vote to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

4.3 Authorized Shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or any class or series thereof may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the number of shares of Common Stock or, in the case of a class or series of Common Stock, such class or series, then outstanding plus (ii) with respect to Class A Common Stock, the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Article V, Section 9) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided that the number of authorized shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be increased or decreased without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt contains provisions related to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and authorized shares.

For Q1, I found the following provision:
""Except as provided in Article IX above, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate, from and after the Final Conversion Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with, Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article X.""

This provision indicates that a vote of shareholders is required to amend certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

For Q2, the provision states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock is required. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""66.67"".

For Q3, since the required percentage is two-thirds, which is greater than 50%, the answer is ""Yes"".

For Q4, the provision states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments or repeals of certain articles (Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, or Article X). Therefore, the answer to Q4 is ""Article III, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article X"".

```",,TRUE,hallucination,"**Analysis of the LLM's Response:**

1. **Q1 - Is there a provision for a supermajority vote?**
   - The LLM correctly identifies the provision indicating a two-thirds supermajority vote requirement for amending certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. This matches the instructions, which define a supermajority as typically requiring more than a simple majority of stockholder votes.

2. **Q2 - What percentage is required?**
   - The LLM accurately states that the provision requires at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares, consistent with the task's definition of a supermajority percentage.

3. **Q3 - If no supermajority, what is the language?**
   - The LLM's response is marked correctly as ""Yes"" for a supermajority requirement, making Q3 irrelevant. However, the response mistakenly included the answer ""Yes"" for Q3 instead of noting that it is not applicable due to a confirmed supermajority requirement.

4. **Q4 - Supermajority applies to a subset of articles?**
   - The LLM replies accurately that the supermajority applies specifically to Articles III, V, VI, VII, VIII, and X, as indicated in the provision.

**Misinterpretations or Divergences:**
- The LLM incorrectly answered ""Yes"" for Q3 when this question only applies if there is a ""No"" for a supermajority requirement. The correct approach should have been to either skip or indicate that Q3 is ""Not Applicable"" given the context.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the LLM correctly identified the supermajority requirement, the specific percentage needed, and which articles it applies to. However, it incorrectly addressed an inapplicable question (Q3). Therefore, a minor hallucination occurred in failing to indicate Q3's irrelevance when a supermajority is confirmed.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

A. The name of this corporation is Gores Metropoulos, Inc. Its original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 28, 2018. The Corporation filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 31, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

B. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of this corporation and by the stockholders in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

C. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

D. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

1.2 Following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and immediately prior to the Corporation's consummation of any business combination, each share of Class F Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall automatically be converted into one (1) share of Class A Common Stock without any action on the part of any person, including the Corporation, and concurrently with such conversion, the number of authorized shares of Class F Common Stock shall be reduced to zero. It is intended that the conversion of Class F Common Stock into Class A Common Stock will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

3.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters.

3.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws"") and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to ten (10) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date.

Section 4. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, relating to the administration of the conversion of shares of the Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock as it may deem necessary or advisable. If the Corporation has reason to believe that a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has occurred, the Corporation may request that the purported transferor furnish affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as it reasonably deems necessary to determine whether a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has occurred, and if such transferor does not within ten (10) days after the date of such request furnish sufficient (as determined in good faith by the Board) evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the request) to enable the Corporation to determine that no such Transfer has occurred, any such shares of Class B Common Stock, to the extent not previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and such conversion shall thereupon be registered on the books and records of the Corporation. In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be presumptive evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and the classes of shares held by each such stockholder and the number of shares of each class held by such stockholder.

Section 5. The Corporation shall not (by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a single class, amend, alter, repeal or waive this Section 5 of Article V.

6.2 ""Effectiveness Date"" shall mean the date of the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Section 8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 1, 2 or 3 of this Article V, if the date on which any share of Class B Common Stock is converted into Class A Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1, 2 or 3 of this Article V occurs after the record date for the determination of the holders of Class B Common Stock entitled to receive any dividend or distribution to be paid on the shares of Class B Common Stock, the holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock as of such record date will be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution on such payment date; provided, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, to the extent that any such dividend or distribution is payable in shares of Class B Common Stock, such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable in, shares of Class A Common Stock and no shares of Class B Common Stock shall be issued in payment thereof.

Section 9. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting conversions of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, such number of duly authorized shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the number of authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, the Corporation shall promptly take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. All shares of Class A Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares. The Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all such shares of Class A Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation.

Section 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, except as otherwise provided by law. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

Section 2. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the total number of directors constituting the Whole Board shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies or unfilled seats in previously authorized directorships.

Section 2. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board shall require the approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock issued pursuant to any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (b) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder in such stockholder's capacity as such arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may be amended from time to time); (d) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (e) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (f) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article X shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

If any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including without limitation, all portions of any section of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 1. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation), and subject to Sections 1 and 2.1 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions.

Section 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as single classes, shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, Section 3 of Article IV or this Section 2 of this Article XII.

* * * IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Gores Metropoulos, Inc. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its duly authorized officer on this 2nd day of December, 2020.

1.3 The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law, and no vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII"".

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII"".

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII"". The supermajority requirement applies to amendments or repeals of these specific sections.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Question 1 - Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a supermajority vote to amend the Certificate?

The LLM correctly identified that a supermajority vote is required for certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation to be amended. The excerpt provided states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power... is required"" for amendments related to specific sections (Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, Article V, etc.). Thus, the LLM's response of ""Yes"" is accurate.

Step 2: Question 2 - What percentage is required?

The LLM correctly interpreted the percentage as 66.67%, which corresponds to two-thirds (2/3) and is a typical supermajority requirement mentioned in such contexts.

Step 3: Question 3 - Is the percentage a supermajority?

The LLM response is correct. 66.67% is indeed a supermajority since it is greater than 50%.

Step 4: Question 4 - Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is that subset?

The LLM correctly identified that the supermajority is only applicable to specific articles: Sections 1.3 and 2 of Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII, as per the excerpt.

FIFTH: Upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class B Common Stock"" and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the ""Old Common Stock""), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without the payment of any additional consideration or other action on the part of the Corporation or the holder thereof, be automatically reclassified as one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock. Certificates representing shares of Old Common Stock shall, immediately after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Old Common Stock represented thereby shall have been reclassified pursuant to this Article FIFTH. The Corporation may, but shall not be obliged to, issue new certificates representing the shares of Common Stock outstanding as a result of the reclassification provided herein unless and until (i) the certificates representing any shares of Old Common Stock so reclassified are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent or (ii) the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

A. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The directors in Class A shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors in Class B shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the directors in Class C shall be elected for a term expiring at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to such classes upon the classification of the Board of Directors. Commencing at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of Directors (including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause) may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

B. In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, power, privileges and discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power, without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the Bylaws as provided in the Bylaws. The Corporation may in its Bylaws confer powers upon its Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by applicable law. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve such adoption, amendment or repeal, such adoption, amendment or repeal shall only require, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

D. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of the State of Delaware, of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and to the Bylaws; provided, however, that no bylaw shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which was valid prior to such bylaw having been made.

A. The personal liability of the directors of the Corporation to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as director is hereby eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article Eighth, or the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article Eighth, shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article Eighth to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, (i) shall indemnify, advance expenses to and hold harmless (a) its current and former directors and officers and (b) any person who, while a director or officer, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said section as amended or supplemented (or any successor); provided, however, that except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or an advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any such director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors and (ii) may provide indemnification or advance expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation or other persons as set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation and on such terms and conditions and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article EIGHTH shall not adversely affect any rights or protection existing hereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder) or (v) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section A will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

TENTH: From time to time any of the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article Tenth; provided that in addition to the vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and this Article TENTH of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by on this 21st day of December 2020.

[Signature Page to Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

A. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board of Directors"") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such series shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to any other series of Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law. The number of authorized shares of the Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

B. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article TENTH that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock of the Corporation representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and this Article TENTH of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""75"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 75% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Articles SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and this Article TENTH"". The excerpt specifically states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments or repeals of these articles.

}
```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step in relation to the provided excerpts and instructions:

1. **Q1 Analysis: Vote Requirement for Amendments**
   - The LLM correctly identifies a provision requiring a supermajority vote of 75% of the voting power to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation.
   - The excerpt specifies that this applies to Articles SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and TENTH.
   - The response aligns with the provided instruction that states the presence of a supermajority requirement should be coded as ""Yes."" Given the required percentage exceeds 50%, this correctly qualifies as a supermajority.

2. **Q2 Analysis: Percentage Required**
   - The LLM identifies the necessary percentage as 75%, correctly obtaining this figure from the excerpt. This matches the expected output if a supermajority is required.

3. **Q3 Analysis: Supermajority Criterion**
   - While this specific question (if the percentage is a supermajority) wasn't directly asked in the task instructions, it is implicitly confirmed since the percentage required (75%) is greater than 50%.

4. **Q4 Analysis: Subset of Articles**
   - The LLM response indicates that the supermajority requirement applies to specific articles (SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, and TENTH), which aligns with the language in the excerpt.

**Final Considerations:**
- The responses provided by the LLM are consistent with the directions of the task instructions and the information in the excerpts.
- There are no fabricated details or incorrect interpretations in the LLM's response; it bases its answers solidly on the excerpts provided.

**Conclusion:**
The LLM did not make any hallucinations in its responses, as it effectively adheres to the task requirements and aligns with the relevant text in the excerpts.

"2. The Original Certificate was amended and restated on March 5, 2020 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both amends and restates the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, without a vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such Preferred Stock holders is required pursuant to the provisions established by the board of directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such Preferred Stock, and if such holders of such Preferred Stock are so entitled to vote thereon, then, except as may otherwise be set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended from time to time (this ""Certificate""), the only stockholder approval required shall be the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock so entitled to vote, voting together as a single class.

A. Authority and Number of Directors. The Board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation (the ""Bylaws""), without any action on the part of the stockholders, by the vote of at least a majority of the directors of the Corporation then in office. In addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or this Certificate, the Bylaws may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board. The authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. Other than for those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, which shall be as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, Paragraph B hereof, each director shall serve until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws shall so provide.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend in any respect or repeal this Article IX, Paragraph A of Article V, or Articles VI, VII or VIII.

2. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate, each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in respect of each share of stock held by such holder of record on the books of the Corporation for the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. No holder of shares of Common Stock shall have the right to cumulative votes.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that ""The affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend in any respect or repeal this Article IX, Paragraph A of Article V, or Articles VI, VII or VIII.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation is required.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Articles VI, VII, VIII, Article IX, and Paragraph A of Article V"". The excerpt states that the supermajority requirement applies to amend or repeal these specific articles.

1. **Is there a provision requiring a supermajority to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?**
   - The LLM states ""Yes,"" noting the requirement of ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%)"" to amend certain sections. This matches the excerpt: ""The affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent..."" Thus, this interpretation is correct.

2. **Percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**
   - The LLM correctly transcribes this as 66.67%. It accurately reflects the text's ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent.""

3. **Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e., >50%)?**
   - The LLM concludes ""Yes,"" which is accurate since 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. **Is the supermajority requirement only for a subset of articles, and if so, what is the subset?**
   - The excerpt specifies Articles IX, VI, VII, VIII, and Paragraph A of Article V. The LLM accurately identifies these, so this part is also correct.

Overall, the LLM's answers are aligned with the information provided in the excerpt.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

2. An amended and restated certificate of incorporation which both restated and amended the provisions of the Original Certificate of Incorporation, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL""), and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 20, 2020 (the ""First A&R Certificate of Incorporation""). The name under which the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation was filed is ""dMY Technology Group, Inc.""

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL.

5. The First A&R Certificate of Incorporation is being amended and restated in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 27, 2020, by and among the Corporation, dMY Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ""dMY Sponsor""), Rush Street Interactive, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, Rush Street Interactive GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as the Sellers' Representative, and the other parties thereto, as amended and restated by the parties thereto on October 9, 2020 (as further amended, modified, amended and restated, supplemented or waived from time to time, the ""Combination Agreement""). As part of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, all 5,750,000 shares of the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation were converted on a 1-for-1 basis into 5,750,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation such that, at the effectiveness of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, only Class A Common Stock remains outstanding. All Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the effectiveness of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and all Class A Common Stock issued as part of the Combination Agreement and the Subscription Agreements contemplated by the Combination Agreement shall be Class A Common Stock for all purposes of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation.

6. This Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation hereby amends and restates the provisions of the First A&R Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety as follows:

Section 4.1 Authorized Capital Stock. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 951,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""), (ii) 750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class A Common Stock""), and (iii) 200,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class V Common Stock"" and together with the Class A Common Stock, the ""Common Stock""). The number of authorized shares of any of the Class A Common Stock, Class V Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of such class or series then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Class A Common Stock, the Class V Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (the ""Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation"") or any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, each holder of record of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote or holders of Class A Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote, including the election or removal of directors (whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by law, each holder of record of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class V Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally or holders of Class V Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote, including the election or removal of directors (whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); provided, however, to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(f) Splits. If the Corporation at any time combines or subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, amendment of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, scheme, arrangement or otherwise) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, the shares of Class V Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately similarly combined or subdivided such that the ratio of shares of outstanding Class V Common Stock to shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such subdivision shall be maintained immediately after such combination or subdivision. Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(f) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision becomes effective.

Section 8.1 Limited Liability of Directors. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such amendment or repeal.

(g) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article X shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable law.

Section 12.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation (i) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (ii) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former officer or director or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however, that, in the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.

"1. Equal Status; Ranking. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Certificate of Incorporation"") or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock will have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

(b) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the resolution(s) or any Preferred Stock Designation providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election and removal of directors and for all other purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote or act by written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of Incorporation) on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock unless the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

11. Protective Provisions. So long as any shares of Class V Common Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, reclassification of capital stock or otherwise, amend, alter, change, repeal or waive any provision in Section A of this Article IV (or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith) that would adversely affect the rights of holders of Class V Common Stock, without first obtaining the approval of the Founder, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws.

To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no current or former director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. No repeal or modification of this Article VI shall apply to or have any adverse effect on any right or protection of, or any limitation of the liability of, a current or former director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification. For purposes of this Article VI, Article VII, Article IX and Article XII, references to ""director"" or ""officer"" shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, any person who has served as a director or officer of Oaktree Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company.

The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, shall indemnify, advance expenses and hold harmless all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto (including current and former directors). The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide rights to indemnification and to advancement of expenses to such other employees or agents of the Corporation or its subsidiaries to such extent and to such effect as the Board shall determine to be appropriate and authorized by the DGCL. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a current or former officer or director of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized hereby. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any rights or protection existing hereunder immediately prior to such repeal or modification.

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation, or in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any provision (other than such article or section as renumbered, or this sentence), in each case, of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Article VI, Article VII, and this sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

B. Amendment by Stockholders. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the Bylaws may also be amended, altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote or written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon; provided, however, that if the Board recommends that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at such meeting of stockholders, such amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on such amendment, alteration or repeal.

A. Forum Selection. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Certificate of Incorporation, as provided by law or by the resolution(s) or any Preferred Stock Designation providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock will (i) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote or to be acted upon by written consent (if action by written consent of the stockholders is not prohibited at such time under this Certificate of Incorporation) of the stockholders of the Corporation, (ii) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time, the ""Bylaws""), and (iii) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each holder of Class A Common Stock will have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class V Common Stock will have the right to 175 votes per share of Class V Common Stock held of record by such holder.

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 3,035,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 2,750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class V Common Stock"" and together with Class A Common Stock, ""Common Stock""), and (iii) 275,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation...""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"" for most provisions, but ""66 2/3%"" for certain provisions (Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation).

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66 2/3% requirement, but ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement of 66 2/3% is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article XI, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XIV and this sentence of this Certificate of Incorporation.

Note that the answers to Q2 and Q3 are not straightforward, as there are two different percentages required for different provisions. I have tried to reflect this complexity in the JSON object.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis**: 

1. **Q1 (Supermajority Vote Requirement)**: 
   - **Correct Interpretation**: The LLM correctly identifies that a supermajority vote is required for certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation. 
   - **Justification**: The excerpts explicitly mention a supermajority requirement (66 2/3%) for amending certain articles. The LLM's response correctly notes that a supermajority is required to amend Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV.

2. **Q2 (Percentage Required)**:
   - **Correct Interpretation**: The LLM appropriately clarifies that different percentages apply. The general amendment requires only a majority vote (50%), while specific articles require 66 2/3%.
   - **Clarification**: The response correctly identifies the need for different voting percentages for different provisions.

3. **Q3 (Supermajority Requirement Applicability)**:
   - **Misinterpretation**: The LLM states ""Yes"" and ""No"" without enough clarity concerning their application. The excerpts and task instructions indicate that ""Yes"" should apply in recognizing the supermajority requirement for specific articles, not in general terms.

4. **Q4 (Specific Articles Requiring Supermajority)**:
   - **Correct Interpretation**: The LLM correctly identifies and lists the specific articles that require a supermajority vote for amendments. 

**Conclusion**: The LLM mostly interprets the excerpt accurately relating to the supermajority requirement but slightly misrepresents the instructions in Q3 by combining ""Yes"" and ""No"" where precision was needed. The task was interpreted correctly overall, but minor procedural issues were noted in the detailed explanation.

"TWO: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates and integrates and also further amends the provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation, was duly adopted by the Company's Board of Directors and stockholders in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

THREE: The Company's certificate of incorporation is hereby amended, integrated and restated to read as follows:

(d) ""Certificate of Incorporation"" means the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended and/or restated from time to time, including the terms of any certificate of designation of any series of Preferred Stock.

(c) Voting Generally. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate series or classes. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company, governed by the internal affairs doctrine or otherwise related to the Company's internal affairs, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

B. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph C. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and (ii) so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall be required to adopt, amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock or the holders thereof in respect of such shares.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Panacea Acquisition Corp. has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of this 10th day of February, 2021.

C. Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

C. The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Voting Power of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock or the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.

(d) Liquidation Event. So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not effect or approve any Liquidation Event without, in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

First, I will look for provisions that require a vote of shareholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it.

I found the following relevant provisions:

* Article VIII, paragraph C: ""Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VII and VIII...""
* Article VIII, paragraph C: ""...and (ii) so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall be required to adopt, amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock or the holders thereof in respect of such shares.""

Based on these provisions, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

Answer: Yes

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Answer: 66.67 (for amendments to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII) and a majority (50%) for amendments that affect the powers, preferences, or rights of Class B Common Stock

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Answer: Yes (for amendments to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII)

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Answer: Yes, the supermajority requirement applies to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII.

Note that I did not include the provision related to Class B Common Stock in the JSON object, as it requires a majority vote (50%) which is not a supermajority.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis:**

1. **Q1 Analysis: Supermajority Requirement Confirmation:**
   - The LLM accurately identifies that there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote for certain amendments. Article VIII, paragraph C states that a supermajority of 66 2/3% is required specifically for amending Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII. This aligns with the task's requirements for coding ""Yes"" for the presence of a supermajority provision.

2. **Q2 Analysis: Percentage of Shareholders Required:**
   - The LLM correctly states that the percentage required for amendments involving Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII is 66 2/3%. The additional mention of a majority (50%) vote for Class B Common Stock affecting amendments is accurate, as it is clearly articulated in the excerpt.

3. **Q3 Analysis: Supermajority Interpretation:**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority percentage is 66 2/3%, which is indeed more than the standard 50% majority, thus qualifying as a supermajority as per the given instructions.

4. **Q4 Analysis: Subset of Articles:**
   - The LLM correctly points out that the supermajority requirement is specifically limited to Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII. This specificity matches the provision description found in the excerpts.

5. **Misinterpretation or Hallucination Analysis:**
   - The LLM's response is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts. The explanations regarding supermajorities, specific articles affected, and the percentage specifications are accurate and align with the task requirements and excerpts' content. No contradictions, misinterpretations, or hallucinations are present in this response.

**Conclusion:**
The LLM's response accurately interprets and applies the information available in the excerpts to address the task questions comprehensively. Each question is answered with the correct details from the Certificate of Incorporation, demonstrating a precise understanding of the task requirements.

1. The name of the corporation is Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation. The date of the filing of its original certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware was May 10, 2019 and the date of filing of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation was July 25, 2019.

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the ""Certificate of Incorporation""), which restates, integrates and further amends the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the corporation, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any applicable successor act thereto, as the same may be amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"") and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the corporation.

3. The Certificate of Incorporation is being amended and restated in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of September 23, 2020, by and among the Corporation (as defined below), Lightning Merger Sub Inc. and ChargePoint, Inc. (as amended, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time, the ""Business Combination Agreement""). As part of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, 984,706 of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock of the Corporation were forfeited to the Corporation for no consideration and the remaining 6,868,235 shares of the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation were converted on a 1-for-1 basis into 6,868,235 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation such that, at the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation, only Class A Common Stock remains outstanding. All Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation and all Class A Common Stock issued as part of the Business Combination Agreement and the subscription agreements contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement shall be Common Stock for all purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation.

4. The certificate of incorporation of the corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

2. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of all of the stockholders of the Corporation, including the election or removal of directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or the DGCL.

3. Any repeal or amendment of this Part B of Article SEVENTH by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Part B of Article SEVENTH, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The Corporation reserves the right at any time from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the DGCL may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TENTH. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH, and in each case, the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision (including, without limitation, any such article or section as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation). Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Article SEVENTH, and this sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

ELEVENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board is expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding shares of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, however, that no Bylaw hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that was valid at the time of such act prior to the adoption of such Bylaw.

(a) Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the ""Court of Chancery"") (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the state or federal courts in the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, stockholder or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as the foregoing may be amended, modified, supplemented and/or restated from time to time), or (4) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, (a) any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination) and (b) any action asserted to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or, in each case, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of this 26 day of February, 2021.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,010,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.

G. Removal. Subject to any rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, any director or the entire Board may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting as a single class. For purposes of this Section G, ""cause"" shall mean, with respect to any director, (i) the willful failure by such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such director in performing, the duties of a director, (ii) the engaging by such director in willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation or (iii) the conviction of such director of, or the entering by such director of a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article TENTH, which states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any of Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH...""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article TENTH as ""66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation"".

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". Since 66.67% is greater than 50%, it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and this Article TENTH"". This is stated in Article TENTH as the specific articles that require a supermajority vote to amend.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the LLM's response to determine if any hallucinations have occurred.

### Step 1: Verifying the Requirement of a Supermajority Vote

**Question 1** involves determining if a supermajority is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.

- **Excerpts Verification**: The excerpt clearly states that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with"" certain articles.
- **LLM's Response**: The LLM correctly identified this requirement and answered ""Yes"" for the need for a supermajority vote.

### Step 2: Identifying the Percentage Required for Amendment

**Question 2** asks for the specific percentage if a supermajority vote is needed.

- **Excerpts Verification**: The same section of the excerpt highlights ""66 2/3%,"" which equates to ""66.67%.""
- **LLM's Response**: The LLM accurately noted ""66.67"" as the percentage, consistent with the excerpt.

### Step 3: Verifying if the Percentage is a Supermajority

**Question 3** asks whether the percentage is a supermajority (> 50%).

- **Excerpts Verification**: The LLM logically reasoned from the excerpts that ""66.67%"" is greater than 50%, and thus a supermajority.
- **LLM's Response**: This conclusion is correct, demonstrating no hallucination for this part.

### Step 4: Determining the Specific Subset of Articles that Require a Supermajority

**Question 4** looks into whether the supermajority applies to a subset of articles.

- **Excerpts Verification**: The excerpt mentions several articles, specifically Parts A and B of Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article ELEVENTH, Article TWELFTH, and Article TENTH itself.
- **LLM's Response**: The LLM listed the articles properly, aligning with the excerpt's content.

### Conclusion:

The LLM consistently followed the instruction's requirements without introducing misinformation or fabricating details. Each segment of the response corresponds accurately with the information in the excerpts, reinforcing the absence of hallucination.

If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article IX to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

A.

1. **Q1 - Supermajority Provision Analysis:**
   The LLM asserts that there is a provision requiring a supermajority to amend the Certificate of Incorporation and specifies that this supermajority is 66 2/3%.

The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more classes or series, and to fix for each such class or series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series, including, without limitation, the authority to provide that any such class or series may be (i) subject to redemption at such time or times and at such price or prices; (ii) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-cumulative) at such rates, on such conditions, and at such times, and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or any other series; (iii) entitled to such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation; or (iv) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock, or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock, of the Corporation at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange and with such adjustments; all as may be stated in such resolution or resolutions.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article TWELFTH: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this A&R Certificate inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH and TENTH of this A&R Certificate or this Article TWELFTH.""

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer to Q2 is ""66.67"". The excerpt states that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors is required.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer to Q3 is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer to Q4 is ""Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH, TENTH, TWELFTH"". The excerpt states that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments inconsistent with the purpose and intent of these specific articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

```
{
    ""Quote"": ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power [...] shall be required to amend [...] any provision as part of this A&R Certificate [...] of Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH and TENTH of this A&R Certificate or this Article TWELFTH."",

    ""Q4-supermajority-only-for-subset-of-articles"": ""Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH, TENTH, TWELFTH""
}
```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Analyzing the LLM's Response to Q1

The LLM correctly identifies the provision in Article TWELFTH of the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a supermajority vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) for amendments. 

The LLM states:
""The answer to Q1 is 'Yes'. The excerpt states in Article TWELFTH: 'the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this A&R Certificate inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH and TENTH of this A&R Certificate or this Article TWELFTH.'""

This conforms with the excerpt and correctly answers Q1 with ""Yes.""

Step 2: Analyzing the LLM's Response to Q2

The LLM states the percentage required for amendment as ""66.67."" This is consistent with the excerpt that uses the specific language ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%).""

The answer is correctly expressed as ""66.67%.""

Step 3: Analyzing the LLM's Response to Q3 and Q4

Q3 asks if 66.67% is a supermajority, and the LLM correctly answers ""Yes."" A requirement of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority, as it exceeds the majority threshold of 50%.

Q4 asks if the supermajority requirement applies to only a subset of articles, and the LLM mentions ""Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH, TENTH, TWELFTH.""

The provision explicitly states: ""shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this A&R Certificate inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Articles FIFTH, EIGHTH, and TENTH of this A&R Certificate or this Article TWELFTH."" This means the answer for Q4 is accurately given.

Analysis: The LLM successfully identified the relevant supermajority provision in the Certificate of Incorporation, corroborated the requisite percentage, confirmed this as a supermajority, and stated correctly that it applies to specific articles. No contradictions, inaccuracies, or divergences from the task instructions are present.

Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of Paragraph B of Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII or this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any person existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

The 50% requirement is not included in the JSON object as it is not a supermajority requirement.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response to determine if it made a hallucination.

1. **Question 1**: The task asks if there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. The LLM correctly identifies that Article IX, Section A, specifies different percentages for different articles: 66.67% for important sections and a majority (50%) for less crucial sections. The excerpt supports the LLM's assertion that there is a requirement for a supermajority to amend certain provisions, so the response to Question 1 is accurate.

2. **Question 2**: The response correctly identifies the percentage as 66.67% for supermajority-required sections and 50% for others. The excerpt explicitly states that 66.67% is necessary for specific articles, which supports this part of the response.

3. **Question 3**: When asked if this percentage qualifies as a supermajority, the LLM rightly answers ""Yes"" for 66.67% and ""No"" for 50%. This is consistent with the definitions provided in the original task instructions.

4. **Question 4**: The LLM states the supermajority requirement of 66.67% applies only to certain articles, which the excerpt confirms, detailing which sections require a supermajority. 

Throughout the response, the LLM does display a clear understanding of the materials provided and adheres to the task instructions, confirming details against the excerpts and articulate responses regarding the applicability of a supermajority.

The LLM's response reflects an accurate interpretation of the excerpts and aligns with the task instructions. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or hallucinations present in the analysis or response generation.

On and after the Amendment Trigger Date, the Bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed and new bylaws made by (i) the Board or (ii) by the stockholders with, in addition to the vote of any holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any resolution setting forth the terms of any series of Preferred Stock), the Bylaws or applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class.

(ii) Except as otherwise required in this Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of Class A Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote (and, if any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Class A Common Stock, as a single class with such holders of Preferred Stock).","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt contains several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend certain sections of the Certificate of Incorporation. For example, Section 4 of ARTICLE EIGHT requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock to alter, amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this ARTICLE EIGHT.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". As mentioned earlier, Section 4 of ARTICLE EIGHT requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is not simply ""No"". The supermajority requirement applies to specific sections of the Certificate of Incorporation, including ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN. Therefore, the answer is ""ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN"".

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM response step by step against the provided excerpts and task instructions:

1. **Q1 Analysis (Vote of Shareholders Required to Amend Charter):**
   - The LLM response is ""Yes"", and refers to Section 4 of ARTICLE EIGHT, which indeed requires the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power for changes. This interpretation is accurate and supported by the provided excerpts.

2. **Q2 Analysis (Percentage Required):**
   - The LLM identifies the required percentage as ""66.67"". The excerpts specifically mention ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%)"", which is correctly simplified as 66.67% in percentage terms. This matches the task instructions regarding percentage expression.

3. **Q3 Analysis (Supermajority of Shareholders to Amend Charter):**
   - The response of ""Yes"" is correct as the percentage identified (66.67%) indeed constitutes a supermajority, which is more than the standard 50%.

4. **Q4 Analysis (Supermajority Requirement Only for a Subset of Articles):**
   - The LLM correctly indicates that the supermajority applies to specific articles stated in the excerpts: ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN. This interpretation aligns with the information provided in the excerpts regarding supermajority requirements for these specified articles.

The LLM has accurately extracted and interpreted the required information from the excerpts without any contradictions or misinterpretations. Therefore, it has not made a hallucination in its response to the task.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY, DATED OCTOBER 1, 2020

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into (a) one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), without any further action by the Company or any stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Company in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

FOUR: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

FIVE: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed on this 1st day of October, 2020.

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article VIII, Section B.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles V, VI, VII and VIII"". This is stated in Article VIII, Section B.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step:

1. **Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?**

The LLM correctly identified that there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote. The excerpt from Article VIII, Section B does state that ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power"" is needed to amend certain articles. This satisfies the condition for a supermajority requirement, as it is more than a simple majority.

2. **If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The LLM correctly identifies the percentage required as 66.67% (interpreting 66 2/3%). This is explicitly mentioned in the same article.

3. **Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

The LLM accurately classified 66.67% as a supermajority, which is correct since it is greater than 50%.

4. **Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

The LLM correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement applies only to a subset of articles: Articles V, VI, VII, and VIII, as stated in Article VIII, Section B of the provided excerpts.

The LLM's response accurately reflects the content of the provided excerpts without any contradictions or misinterpretations. Each part of the task has been addressed according to the task instructions using the correct interpretations of the text.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF CURIOSITYSTREAM INC., DATED AS OF OCTOBER 14, 2020

1. The name of the Corporation is ""Software Acquisition Group Inc."". The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 9, 2019. The Corporation filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 19, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with Secretary of State of Delaware.

4. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) Reclassification. Effective immediately upon the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each share of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation, par value of $0.0001 (the ""Class A Common Stock""), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any further action by any stockholder, be renamed as, and shall become, one share of Common Stock. Any outstanding stock certificate that represented shares of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall from and after the Effective Time be deemed to represent the same number of shares of Common Stock, without the need for surrender or exchange thereof. Further, any book-entry notation that represented shares of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be revised to represent the same number of shares of Common Stock.

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the By-Laws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof, the ""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

Section 9.1. To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

Section 9.2 Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-laws or applicable law.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.1 shall not apply to any action or proceeding asserting a claim under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

- The LLM correctly identifies the requirement in Article X stating that “the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V.” This indicates that a supermajority is required, at least for some provisions, and matches the supermajority definition in the instructions. The response is accurate for this point.

Step 2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

- The LLM correctly states that the percentage required is 66.7%. The documentation in question supports this with its reference to 66.7%.

Step 3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e., >50%)?

- The percentage of 66.7% is indeed a supermajority. This response is correct and aligns with the instructions.

Step 4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so, what is the subset of articles?

- The LLM accurately responds that the supermajority applies specifically to Article V, as per the provided excerpt, which mentions that Article V requires a 66.7% vote for changes. The LLM specifies that the requirement is limited to Article V, aligning with both the question's details and task instructions.

Overall Analysis:

- The LLM interprets the provision correctly and outputs responses that align with the information in the provided excerpts. Each step matches the requirements laid out by task instructions, without any errors or omissions in understanding.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

ONE: The name of the corporation is Forum Merger II Corporation, which was the name under which the corporation was originally incorporated. The date of the filing of its original certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware was May 4, 2018 and an amended and restated certificate of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 2, 2018.

TWO: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the corporation in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

THREE: The Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each share of the Company's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class B Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""). Immediately following the conversion of such Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, automatically and without further action by any stockholder, be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company with, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this Section A of this Article VII will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

E. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article IX. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Company under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any bylaws or applicable law.

X. A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article X, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, at any time, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX or X in any respect, or to adopt any provision or bylaw inconsistent therewith.

* * * * FOUR: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

FIVE: This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed on this 15th day of October, 2020.

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down whether the LLM hallucinated in its response, based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts.

Step 1: Check if a provision requires a supermajority vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.

- The LLM correctly identifies that the Certificate of Incorporation requires a supermajority vote of 66 2/3% to amend certain articles, as per the excerpt: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, at any time, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX or X..."". 

Step 2: Determine the percentage required for these amendments.

- The LLM accurately finds that the required percentage is ""66.67%"", which corresponds to the 66 2/3% standard supermajority figure.

Step 3: Confirm if this percentage is a supermajority.

- The LLM correctly categorizes 66.67% as a supermajority. 

Step 4: Identify whether this supermajority requirement is for a subset of articles.

- The LLM correctly points out that the supermajority requirement applies to Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X.

Each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote for each share held by such holder on all matters voted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Section 4. Amendment of this Article. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, and in addition to any vote required by applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this ARTICLE EIGHT; provided however, that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the alteration, amendment or repeal of this ARTICLE EIGHT nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this ARTICLE EIGHT shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any Exempted Person for or with respect to any activities or opportunities which such Exempted Person becomes aware prior to such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption.

Section 2. Amendments to this Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the capital stock required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation, or otherwise, no provision of ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN or ARTICLE ELEVEN of this Certificate of Incorporation may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless in addition to any other vote required by this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise required by law, (i) during a Controlled Period, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, and (ii) other than during a Controlled Period, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66&frac23;%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, at a meeting of the Corporation's stockholders called for that purpose.

Nothing in this Certificate of Incorporation shall preclude a director from serving consecutive terms. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation (as amended and/or restated the ""Bylaws"") shall so provide.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Section 2 states that ""no provision of ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN or ARTICLE ELEVEN of this Certificate of Incorporation may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect... unless... such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class"" during a Controlled Period, and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66&frac23;%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, other than during a Controlled Period.

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

There are two different percentages mentioned in the excerpt, depending on whether it is during a Controlled Period or not. During a Controlled Period, a majority (50%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock is required. Other than during a Controlled Period, at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66&frac23;%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock is required.

However, for ARTICLE EIGHT, a higher percentage of 80% is required.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentages mentioned are supermajorities. 66&frac23;% and 80% are both greater than 50%.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles. For ARTICLE EIGHT, an 80% supermajority is required. For ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, and ARTICLE ELEVEN, a 66&frac23;% supermajority is required, except during a Controlled Period when a majority is sufficient.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

```
{
    ""Quote"": ""such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single class"",
    ""Q1-Vote-of-Shareholders-Required-to-Amend-Charter"": ""Yes"",
    ""Q2-percentage-required"": ""66.67, 80, 50"",

    ""Q4-supermajority-only-for-subset-of-articles"": ""ARTICLE EIGHT, ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, ARTICLE ELEVEN""
}
```

Note that the Q2-percentage-required field contains multiple values, as there are different percentages mentioned in the excerpt depending on the context.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts provided.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Q1: Is there a requirement for a supermajority vote?**
   - The LLM correctly identifies that there is a supermajority requirement for certain amendments outside a Controlled Period. Section 2 of the provided excerpts states the need for a 66⅔% vote for certain articles, with ARTICLE EIGHT specifically requiring an 80% vote.

2. **Q2: If yes, what percentage?**
   - The LLM notes the percentages as 66⅔% and 80%, which aligns with the excerpts. The separate mention of a 50% requirement (majority) during a Controlled Period is also indicated correctly.
   - While this step contains correct information, it's unclear from the formulation requested whether multiple percentages should be included or just the supermajority required during non-controlled periods (66⅔% and 80%).

3. **Q3: Does the percentage constitute a supermajority?**
   - The LLM correctly identifies 66⅔% and 80% as supermajority percentages.

4. **Q4: Is the supermajority requirement limited to a subset of articles?**
   - The response accurately identifies the subset of articles (ARTICLE FIVE, ARTICLE SIX, ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE NINE, ARTICLE TEN, ARTICLE ELEVEN) that require a 66⅔% after exiting the Controlled Period. ARTICLE EIGHT's separate requirement of 80% is also correctly noted.

**Potential Points of Misunderstanding or Misinterpretation:**
- The LLM’s response did not question whether stating the 50% majority vote alongside the supermajority percentages was relevant to Q2. However, the inclusion did not lead to misinterpretation, but a cleaner response might've focused solely on the 66⅔% and 80% initially requested.

- No evidence or steps indicate addressing if percentages below the supermajority threshold were tested, such as confirmation that the ""Controlled Period"" conditions met appropriate identifiers across articles.

**Conclusion:**
The LLM’s response correctly reflects the excerpts and the task instructions, identifying sections applicable and correctly recognizing supermajority requirements from the text provided. There are no material hallucinations in the response.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"" because the excerpt mentions ""alter, amend or add to these Articles"" which implies that there is a provision for amending the Articles.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

However, the excerpt does not provide the specific percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is ""NA"".

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Since Q2 is ""NA"", Q3 is also ""NA"".

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

Similarly, Q4 is also ""NA"" since Q2 and Q3 are ""NA"".

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

    ""Quote"": ""alter, amend or add to these Articles"",
    ""Q1-Vote-of-Shareholders-Required-to-Amend-Charter"": ""Yes"",

}
```",,TRUE,hallucination,"To determine if the LLM's response contains any hallucination, we will break down the task questions and analyze the responses given by the LLM according to the instructions and the provided excerpts.

**Q1: Supermajority Requirement**
- **Task Requirement:** Determine if the Certificate of Incorporation requires a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate.
- **LLM's Response to Q1:** The LLM answered ""Yes"" because the excerpt mentions the ability to ""alter, amend or add to these Articles.""
- **Analysis:** The LLM's response indicates that the presence of language allowing amendments means a supermajority is required. However, the LLM made a logical leap here. The mention of amending the articles does not inherently imply the necessity of a supermajority. There is no explicit information about a required percentage or vote, therefore, the correct response to Q1 should be ""NA"" since there's no evidence supporting a supermajority in the excerpt.

**Q2 & Q3: Percentage and Whether it's a Supermajority**
- **Q2 Task Requirement:** Provide the supermajority percentage if Q1 is ""Yes"".
- **LLM's Response to Q2:** The LLM answered ""NA"" indicating no specific percentage was provided.
- **Q3 Task Requirement:** Confirm if the percentage is a supermajority (>50%).
- **Analysis of Q2/Q3:** While the LLM technically answered Q2 correctly, saying ""NA"" for no specified percentage, the reasoning was flawed because Q1 should have been ""NA"" due to insufficient amendments information, which means Q2 should not have been addressed.

**Q4: Subset of Articles**
- **Task Requirement:** Identify if the supermajority applies only to subsets of articles if information from Q2 exists.
- **LLM's Response:** The LLM answered ""NA"", due to no available data.
- **Analysis of Q4:** This aligns with the flow dictated by the instruction, given that Q2 and Q3 should follow from a valid supermajority finding in Q1, which was not applicable due to lacking supermajority information.

**Overall Analysis and Conclusion:**
The LLM's initial evaluation of Q1 was incorrect; it assumed the presence of amendment language automatically implies a supermajority requirement. Without specific text indicating a supermajority, this is not definitively supported by the excerpt. Thus, while the LLM stated ""Yes"" based on assumed implications which wasn't explicitly stated, it leads to a hallucinated inference.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY

1. The name of the Corporation is ""Healthcare Merger Corp."" The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 19, 2019 (the ""Original Certificate""). The Corporation filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 12, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate"") was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") and the stockholders of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to time, the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with Secretary of State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation, as they may be further amended from time to time (""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(a) The total number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by at least a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term ""Whole Board"" shall mean the total number of directors then in office, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

(b) The Board shall be divided, with respect to the time for which its members severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III at the time the classification becomes effective. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; provided, further, however, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions of the By-Laws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 No Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(e) To the extent an indemnitee has rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by persons or entities other than the Corporation (collectively, the ""Other Indemnitors""), (i) the Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., that its obligations to an indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by an indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by an indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim) to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-Laws and the agreements to which the Corporation is a party, without regard to any rights an indemnitee may have against the Other Indemnitors, and (iii) the Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims against them for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of an indemnitee against the Corporation.

ARTICLE IX
AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and subject to Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal any provision inconsistent with this Article IX, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article X or Article XI (the ""Specified Provisions""); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX.

If any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including without limitation, all portions of any section of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 11.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (a) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by or other wrongdoing by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any action as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware within ten (10) days following such determination), in which case the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware, as applicable, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any such claims. This Article XI shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision or provisions of this Article XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article XI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XI. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.

Section 12.5 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article XII of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the following definitions apply:

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Healthcare Merger Corp. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down whether the LLM hallucinated in its response, based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts.

1. **Q1: Is there a provision in the certificate of incorporation that requires a vote of a supermajority of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation?**

    - The LLM answered ""Yes,"" identifying a requirement for a supermajority vote (two-thirds) to amend specific parts of the Certificate of Incorporation.
    - The provided excerpts indeed mention a requirement for a two-thirds majority to amend certain sections including Article IX, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 of Article IV, and others.
    - The LLM's response here aligns with the excerpts.

2. **Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

    - The LLM gives the percentage as 66.67%.
    - This corresponds to ""two-thirds,"" the percentage explicitly stated in the excerpts.

3. **Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e., > 50%)?**

    - The LLM correctly identified that 66.67% is a supermajority.

4. **Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so, what is the subset of articles?**

    - The LLM answered ""Yes,"" pointing out a specific subset of articles requiring a supermajority vote.
    - The provided excerpts confirm that this requirement applies to specific sections and articles (e.g., Article IX and parts of Article IV, among others).

5. **Contradictions and Misinterpretations:**

   - The LLM response accurately reflects the details given in the excerpts. There are no contradictions or misinterpretations identified in its analysis of the supermajority voting requirement for certain charter provisions.

6. **Divergence from Task Instructions:**

   - The LLM response follows the task instructions properly by assessing the presence of a supermajority requirement, the specified percentage, and the specific application to certain sections of the Certificate.

**Conclusion:**

The LLM's response is accurate and consistent with the excerpts provided. There is no hallucination detected as it closely adheres to the instructions and the text's specifics.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Unsure"" because the excerpt does not explicitly state the voting requirements for amending the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. The excerpt appears to be related to the annual general meeting and the proposal of business, but it does not provide information on the voting requirements for amendments.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Review of Excerpts:**
   - The excerpt provided is focused on procedures related to bringing business before an annual general meeting, including proposing amendments to the Articles.
   - There is no mention of voting requirements, supermajority percentages, or specific procedural details for amending the Certificate of Incorporation.

2. **Question 1: Supermajority Requirement**
   - The LLM response states ""Unsure"" for whether a supermajority is required because the excerpt does not provide information about voting requirements for amendments.
   - Given there is no explicit information about voting requirements in the excerpt, it was appropriate for the LLM to not assert ""Yes"" or ""No"" and opt for ""Unsure.""

3. **Question 2: Percentage Required**
   - The LLM correctly identified that Q2 was not applicable (""NA"") since Q1 was not answered as ""Yes.""
   - This is consistent with the task instructions.

4. **Question 3: Supermajority Percentage**
   - Similarly, for Q3, the LLM answered ""NA"" because Q1 was not ""Yes.""
   - This step follows the logic dictated by earlier question responses.

5. **Question 4: Supermajority for Subset of Articles**
   - The response for Q4 was also ""NA,"" as Q1's conditions for a ""Yes"" answer were not met.
   - Again, this makes logical sense based on previous answers.

Conclusion:
- The LLM tracked consistent logic based on the absence of relevant data in the excerpts.
- No assumptions beyond the provided information were made.
- The response adheres to task instructions through consistent application of conditional logic; the response remains conservative in the absence of clear data.

Although the LLM’s label of ""Unsure"" for Q1 reflects what little information could be garnered from the excerpt, its overall completion generally aligns with task instructions and avoids speculative inferences that would lead to a hallucination.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws, provided, however, that so long as the Director Nomination Agreement remains in effect, the Board shall not approve any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Bylaws, or the adoption of any new bylaw of the Corporation, that would be contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of the Director Nomination Agreement. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Director Nomination Agreement remains in effect, neither the Board nor the stockholders of the Corporation may not approve any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Bylaws, or the adoption of any new bylaw of the Corporation, that would be contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of the Director Nomination Agreement without the written consent of the parties to the Director Nomination Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Bylaws shall be deemed to limit the ability of the parties to the Director Nomination Agreement to amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Director Nomination Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof; provided that no amendment to the Director Nomination Agreement (whether or not such amendment modifies any provision of the Director Nomination Agreement to which the Bylaws are subject) shall amend the Bylaws.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Third Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity pursuant to Section 122(17) of the DGCL. As used herein, an ""Excluded Opportunity"" is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of (i) any director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) any person with the right to designate any such director pursuant to the Director Nomination Agreement (or any of such person's Affiliates or its or their respective successors, principals, directors, officers, members, managers or employees) (collectively, ""Covered Persons""), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, such Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation, and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue. Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any Covered Person existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification. For purposes of this Article IX, ""Affiliate"" means, with respect to any person, any other person that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such person.

Article X

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Third Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 11.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, B. Riley Principal Merger Corp. II has caused this Third Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

[Signature Page to Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states that certain provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation can only be altered, amended, or repealed with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is stated in Article X, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority, as it is greater than 50%.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, Article IV, Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, Article IX and this Article X"". According to Article X, the supermajority requirement applies to these specific articles, which cannot be altered, amended, or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Evaluate if the LLM identified a supermajority requirement correctly.

The LLM correctly identified that there is a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a supermajority vote to amend certain articles of the Certificate of Incorporation. This is supported by the following excerpt from Article X: ""[...] unless in addition to any other vote required by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate or otherwise required by law, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662⁄3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class;""

Step 2: Verify the specified percentage for the supermajority requirement.

The LLM mentions that the supermajority requirement is ""66.67%,"" which aligns with ""sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%)"" stated in the excerpt. The LLM rounds 66 2/3% to 66.67%, which is a reasonable rounding.

Step 3: Determine if the supermajority requirement applies only to a subset of articles.

The LLM correctly notes that Article X specifies that some articles require a supermajority to amend. Article X states that Articles IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, and X require this supermajority.

Step 4: Check for any additional unnecessary information or misinterpretation.

The LLM's responses to the related questions are consistent with the excerpt, provided no unnecessary information outside of what was necessary to address the questions. There is no contradiction or unnecessary elaboration in the LLM’s answers.

Conclusion: The LLM's response is accurate and reflects the information contained in the provided excerpts. The response adheres to the task instructions and interprets the information correctly.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY, DATED DECEMBER 21, 2020

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), without any further action by the Company or any stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Company in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. 1. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

C. If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Company renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Company will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Company, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Company with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and (i) such opportunity is one the Company is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Company to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Company without violating any legal obligation.

FOUR: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

FIVE: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed on this 21st day of December, 2020.

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.""

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Articles V, VI, VII and VIII"". The excerpt states in Article VIII, Section B that the supermajority requirement applies specifically to these articles.

This matches the criteria for a ""Yes"" answer as described in the task instructions.

2. **Q2: What is the percentage?**

"AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY, EFFECTIVE ON DECEMBER 16, 2020

Form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

F. Effect of Modifications. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision contained in this Article EIGHTH shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors or officers) and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any current or former director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

A. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, and all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders of the Corporation by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article ELEVENTH. In addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, and in addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH or this Article ELEVENTH (including, without limitation, any such Article as renumbered as a result of any amendment, alteration, repeal or adoption of any other Article).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed as of the 16th day of December, 2020.

B. Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws may also be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

A. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the GCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.

B. Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any Preferred Stock Designation, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power and each share of Common Stock shall have one vote. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of outstanding Preferred Stock, holders of shares of Common Stock shall have equal rights of participation in the dividends and other distributions in cash, stock, or property of the Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall have equal rights to receive the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt contains provisions related to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the voting power of shareholders.

For Question 1, I found the following provision:

""A. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation.... In addition to any other vote that may be required by law, applicable stock exchange rule or the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation.""

This provision indicates that a vote of shareholders is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is ""Yes"".

For Question 2, I found two different percentages mentioned:

* ""a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation"" (which is equivalent to 50%)
* ""75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation"" (which applies to amendments inconsistent with certain articles)

Since the question asks for the percentage required, I will answer with the higher percentage, which is ""75"".

For Question 3, since the required percentage is 75%, which is greater than 50%, the answer is ""Yes"", it is a supermajority.

For Question 4, I found that the supermajority requirement applies to amendments inconsistent with certain articles, specifically:

""Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH or this Article ELEVENTH""

Therefore, the answer to Question 4 is ""Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, TENTH, ELEVENTH"".

The LLM interprets the excerpt provision as stating that a majority vote is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. However, the LLM marks this as a ""Yes"" for needing a supermajority. The provision states: 

""The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation.""

This indicates a simple majority (50%), not a supermajority, contrary to the LLM's response in Question 1. The initial answer should be ""No.""

**Step 2: Analyze the Response for Question 2**

The LLM asserts that the percentage required is ""75%"" but interprets it for situations involving amendments inconsistent with certain articles. The correct interpretation is as follows:

- The general requirement is a simple majority for amendments.
- A 75% vote is required for amendments involving certain articles: FIFTH to ELEVENTH.

The task specified that if no supermajority applies generally, the percentage should be ""50%."" The response incorrectly presents a simple majority situation as requiring a supermajority universally.

**Step 3: Analyze Response for Question 3**

Since the supermajority is only required in specific circumstances (a subset of articles), not in all cases, Question 3 is not applicable. The LLM categorically stated ""Yes"" for supermajority, although its reasoning only pertains to certain articles.

**Step 4: Analyze Responses for Questions 3 & 4**

Although there is a provision for 75% under specific circumstances, it does not convert the initial majoritarian provision of 50% to a supermajority for general amendment. The only relevance applies when amending certain articles, which is accurate for Question 4, but misrepresented as a general requirement to Question 3.

**Conclusion**

The LLM's interpretation of the excerpt incorrectly suggested a supermajority requirement applied broadly, when the specific context involves a general 50% majority, and only isolated cases require 75%. The tasks and questions were misaligned with the actual provisions in the excerpt.

Each Common share shall entitle its holder to one (1) vote at all meetings of the shareholders of the Company (except meetings at which only holders of another specified class of shares are entitled to vote pursuant to the provisions hereof or pursuant to the provisions of the Act).","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Unsure"" because the excerpt does not explicitly state the voting requirements for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. Although it mentions voting rights for shareholders, it does not specify the percentage of votes required to amend the Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Since the answer to question 1 is ""Unsure"", I will answer ""NA"" for this question.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

Since the answer to question 1 is ""Unsure"", I will answer ""NA"" for this question.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

    ""Q4-supermajority-only-for-subset-of-articles"": ""NA""

Note that the excerpt does not provide enough information to determine the voting requirements for amending the Certificate of Incorporation, so I had to answer ""Unsure"" for question 1 and ""NA"" for the subsequent questions.",,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step to determine if there is a hallucination based on the task instructions and provided excerpts.

1. **Q1: Voting Requirement to Amend the Certificate**
   - The task requires checking if there is a provision that mandates a supermajority vote for amending the Certificate of Incorporation.
   - The provided excerpts don't contain any article or language related to the amendment process of the Certificate of Incorporation, nor do they mention specific voting requirements.
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the information about voting requirements is missing in the provided excerpts.
   - It labels this as ""Unsure,"" which is an appropriate response per the task instructions when the amendment provision is missing.

2. **Q2: Percentage of Shareholders Required**
   - This question is dependent on an affirmative answer to Q1. Since Q1 was labeled ""Unsure,"" the LLM answered ""NA,"" which aligns with the task instructions.

3. **Q3: Is the Percentage a Supermajority?**
   - Again, this question hinges on a definitive percentage being identified in Q1. Given that Q1 was ""Unsure,"" the response ""NA"" is appropriate here as well.

4. **Q4: Is the Supermajority Requirement Only for a Subset of Articles?**
   - Since Q1 was ""Unsure,"" the LLM answered ""NA"" for this question.

The LLM's response correctly follows the logic dictated by the task instructions. Its decision to select ""Unsure"" and ""NA"" stems from the absence of relevant information within the provided excerpts.

Final Determination:
- There are no contradictions or misinterpretations in the LLM’s response relative to the instructions or information provided. It correctly acknowledged the lack of information necessary to form a substantive answer.

1. The name of the Corporation is ""PropTech Acquisition Corporation"". The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 31, 2019. The Corporation filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 21, 2019 (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate. Certain capitalized terms used in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate are defined where appropriate herein.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation (as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof, the ""By-Laws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III.

Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws; and provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

Section 9.1. To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and (i) such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue and (ii) the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal obligation.

Section 9.2. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article IX shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-laws or applicable law.

Step 1: Analysis of Provision for Supermajority Vote

The LLM correctly identifies that a supermajority provision is present in the Certificate of Incorporation. This is found in Article X, which states: ""the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power...shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V."" This aligns with the requirement of a supermajority (> 50%).

Step 2: Identification of Required Percentage

The LLM identifies the required percentage as 66.7%. This is accurate according to the excerpt provided, confirming the vote percentage is a supermajority as the task definition describes.

Step 3: Application of Supermajority Requirement to Articles

The LLM points out that the supermajority requirement applies specifically to Article V. This is supported by the excerpt, which mentions the specific application to Article V for amendments or repeals.

Step 4: Question 1 and Its Related Conclusions

The LLM responds ""Yes"" to the need for a supermajority vote, which is correct. The requirement for 66.7% of voting power aligns perfectly with a supermajority condition, and ""Yes"" is the accurate conclusion.

Step 5: Verification of JSON Object Output

The output JSON provided by the LLM reflects the analysis correctly and mirrors the task's requirements: It correctly encapsulates the supermajority vote, the percentage, its classification as a supermajority, and the specificity to Article V.

Section 5.1 By-Laws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (as the same may be amended from time to time, the ""By-Laws"") without the assent or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Effective Time""), each one share of the Corporation's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Class A Common Stock""), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated and changed into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Corporation, par value $0.0001 per share (the ""Common Stock""), without any further action by the Corporation or any stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a ""Prior Certificate"") shall, until surrendered to the Corporation in exchange for a certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock, automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have been reclassified and redesignated.

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation shall provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers and agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which applicable law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law. If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as so amended.

A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under the Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the Corporation; (B) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (C) any claim or cause of action against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any claim or cause of action against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation, governed by the internal-affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section D of Article VI shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act""), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

C. Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

A. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

The Board of Directors is also expressly authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the general provision, but ""Yes"" for specific sections. The general provision requires a majority vote, which is 50%. However, certain sections, such as Article V, Section 1, Article V, Section 2, Article VI, Section 3, and Article VII, require a two-thirds (2/3) vote, which is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

1. **Analysis of Question 1:**
   - **Task:** Determine if there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.
   - **LLM Response:** ""Yes,"" referencing a need for a majority vote and highlighting specific sections requiring a two-thirds (2/3) vote.
   - **Excerpt Analysis:** The excerpt states: ""Except as otherwise required by this Certificate or by law, whenever any vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation is required to amend or repeal any provision of this Certificate, such amendment or repeal shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares...""
     However, this is specifically contradicted by other parts of the excerpt that require a two-thirds vote for certain articles (e.g., Article V, VI, and VII). 
   - **Conclusion for Q1:** The LLM correctly identifies that there are specific sections requiring a supermajority, leading to the correct response of ""Yes.""

2. **Analysis of Question 2:**
   - **Task:** If ""Yes"" to Q1, specify the supermajority percentage required.
   - **LLM Response:** ""50"", initially stated, then later identifies two-thirds (2/3) for specific sections.
   - **Excerpt Analysis:** A general requirement is indeed a majority (50%) except for specific articles which need two-thirds (66 2/3%).
   - **Conclusion for Q2:** The LLM has provided conflicting information by stating both ""50"" and referencing sections requiring a two-thirds vote. This creates a layered misinterpretation, implying an inaccurate initial percentage while later correcting it in part for the special cases.

3. **Analysis of Further Supermajority Specification (Q3 and Q4 equivalents):**
   - **LLM provides recognition of general majority and specific supermajority for certain sections and correctly identifies these sections.
   - **Conclusion for supermajority details:** No hallucination for the specific articles requiring a supermajority, as they are detailed accurately.

**Final Conclusion:**
The LLM has made a misstep by initially stating a 50% requirement for general amendment, which conflicts with contextually applicable sections that were eventually (and correctly in some instances) mentioned. Its overall response was hindered by initially failing to decisively translate sections needing specific attention, and offering a confusing numeric response that did not address the entire allowance for required percentage variations.

```",,TRUE,no hallucination,"To determine if there is a hallucination in the LLM's response, we must closely analyze each claim it made concerning the Certificate of Incorporation and compare it to the provided excerpts.

**Q1 Analysis: Provision for Supermajority Vote**

- The LLM response is ""Yes"" to the question of whether a provision requires a supermajority vote for certain amendments. It correctly identifies Article Ninth as including such a provision. This matches the excerpt, which states:
  ""the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of voting stock representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power [...] shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, Articles Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth or Ninth of this Certificate of Incorporation.""

Thus, the LLM's statement aligns with the excerpt.

**Q2 Analysis: Required Percentage**

- The LLM gives 66 2/3% as the percentage required, which is accurately derived from the text of the Certificate of Incorporation.

**Q3 Analysis: Supermajority Status**

- The LLM notes that this percentage is a supermajority, which is indeed correct. A 66 2/3% requirement is greater than a simple majority (50%).

**Q4 Analysis: Applicability to Subset of Articles**

- The response correctly identifies that the supermajority requirement applies specifically to Articles Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth. This conforms to what is stated in the excerpts.

**Conclusion**

The LLM's response correctly identifies the provisions and details as stated in the Certificate of Incorporation. There are no hallucinations present, as each point corresponds directly to the provided text in the excerpts.
