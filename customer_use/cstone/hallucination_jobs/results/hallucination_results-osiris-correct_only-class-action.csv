ITEM 8. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Item 8 of this Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by deleting the paragraph under the heading ""--Legal Proceedings"" on page 43 of this Schedule 14D-9 and replacing it with the following paragraphs:

On July 1, 2019, a purported stockholder of Array filed a putative class action lawsuit against Array, its directors, Pfizer and Purchaser in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Michael Kent v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01248 (the ""Kent Complaint""). On July 2, 2019 another purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array, its directors, Pfizer and Purchaser in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Elaine Wang v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06168 (the ""Wang Complaint""). On July 3, 2019 a third purported stockholder of Array filed a putative class action lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Jacques Noel v. Array BioPharma et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01925. On July 8, 2019, a fourth purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Mark Groeschel v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01960. On July 11, 2019, a fifth purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Larry Guerrero v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02000. On July 12, 2019, a sixth purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Mark Wescott v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01304. Also on July 12, 2019, a seventh purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Chanie Dembitzer v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02016.

The complaints allege that Array and its directors, and, in the Kent Complaint and the Wang Complaint, Pfizer and Purchaser, violated Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder because the Schedule 14D-9 is materially deficient, and that Array's directors (acting in their capacity as control persons of Array) and, solely in the Kent Complaint, Pfizer (which the Kent Complaint alleges should also be deemed to be a control person of Array for purposes of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act), violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by filing a materially deficient Schedule 14D-9. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event the Transactions are consummated and (iii) plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees. The defendants believe the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit.

Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01960. On July 11, 2019, a fifth purported stockholder of Array filed a lawsuit against Array and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Larry Guerrero v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02000.

Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01304.

The complaints allege that Array and its directors, and, in the Kent Complaint and the Wang Complaint, Pfizer and Purchaser, violated Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-9 promulgated thereunder because the Schedule 14D-9 is materially deficient, and that Array's directors (acting in their capacity as control persons of Array) and, solely in the Kent Complaint, Pfizer (which the Kent Complaint alleges should also be deemed to be a control person of Array for purposes of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act), violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by filing a materially deficient Schedule 14D-9. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event the Transactions are consummated and (iii) plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees. The defendants believe the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit.

</target_case>
","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I found several mentions of ""putative class action lawsuit"" in the filing excerpts, specifically in the descriptions of the lawsuits filed by Michael Kent, Jacques Noel, and others.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Upon reviewing the mentions of ""putative class action lawsuit"", I confirmed that the case of interest, Mark Groeschel v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01960, is not explicitly stated to be a class action. The mention of ""putative class action lawsuit"" is in the context of other lawsuits, not the specific case of interest.

Since the keyword search did not provide sufficient evidence, I proceeded with the next steps.

3. **Search for other keywords**: I searched for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, I did not find any such language in the context of the case of interest, Mark Groeschel v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01960.

4. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```
{
    ""quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""is_class_action"": ""No"",
    ""note"": ""The case of interest is not explicitly stated to be a class action, and no language suggests that the plaintiff is representing other similarly situated individuals.""
}
```",X1Q6O3QT9QO2,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Search for keyword ""class action""
The LLM correctly identifies mentions of ""putative class action lawsuit"" in the filing excerpts, specifically regarding the lawsuits filed by Michael Kent and Jacques Noel. However, it does not find this mention in relation to the Mark Groeschel case, which is the Target Case.

Step 2: Confirm class action mention
Upon reviewing the excerpts, the LLM rightly notes that the Target Case, Mark Groeschel v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., is not explicitly mentioned as a class action. The keyword “putative class action lawsuit” pertains to other cases and not to the Groeschel case explicitly.

Step 3: Search for other keywords
The LLM searches for language indicating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" but finds no such language related to the Target Case. The excerpt doesn't provide a basis to assume the Target Case is a class action based on other keywords either.

Step 4: Assess negative
The LLM correctly concludes that since the document does not contain relevant keywords or phrases indicating the Target Case is a class action, it is not a class action.

Final Analysis:
The LLM follows the task instructions effectively without any contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences. Its logical progression from searching for keywords to assessing explicit mentions and associated language aligns with the instructions, leading to a consistent conclusion that the Target Case is not a class action.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""putative class action lawsuit"" in several places, specifically in relation to the cases Michael Kent v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01248) and Jacques Noel v. Array BioPharma et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01925). However, the target case is Mark Wescott v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01304).

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Although the document mentions ""putative class action lawsuit"" in relation to other cases, it does not explicitly state that the target case, Mark Wescott v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01304), is a class action.

3. **Search for other keywords**: Since the keyword search did not provide sufficient evidence, I will look for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, the document does not contain such language in relation to the target case.

4. **Assess negative**: Based on the above steps, the document does not provide any information to determine that the target case is a class action.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

}",X1Q6O3S88882,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM hallucinated based on the provided instructions and excerpts.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""
The LLM correctly identified that the document mentions ""putative class action lawsuit"" for the cases of Michael Kent v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01248) and Jacques Noel v. Array BioPharma et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01925). The target case is Mark Wescott v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01304).

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention
The LLM accurately stated that there is no explicit mention in the excerpts that the target case, Mark Wescott v. Array BioPharma Inc., et al., is a class action.

Step 3: Search for Other Keywords
The LLM searched for other language indicating the case could be a class action, such as ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" There was no such language found in the excerpts related to the target case.

Step 4: Assess Negative
The LLM concluded based on the provided steps that there is no evidence to determine the target case is a class action.

Conclusion:
The LLM followed the instructions accurately and provided a well-reasoned analysis concluding that the target case is not a class action. The excerpts do not contain any information indicating that the case of Mark Wescott is a class action. Therefore, there is no hallucination in the LLM's response.

2019-07-22 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/805022/000119312519199048/d778989d8k.htm]:
Item 8.01. | Other Events.

On May 10, 2019, Buckeye Partners, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Buckeye""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Hercules Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), Hercules Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (""ServiceCo""), and Buckeye GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the ""General Partner""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (the ""merger""), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Parent.

Since the May 10, 2019 announcement of the merger agreement, six putative class action complaints and two individual complaints have been filed against Buckeye and the members of the board of directors of the General Partner (the ""Board""). The eight complaints are captioned as follows: Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (filed on June 13, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the ""Curtis Action""), Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128 (filed on June 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Kent Action""), John Greer v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (filed on June 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Greer Action""), Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (filed on June 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Luers Action""), Michael Weston, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01208 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Weston Action""), Heather McManus, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06000 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""McManus Action""), John Ingalls, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06098 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Ingalls Action"") and Michael Riss, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01241 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Riss Action"", collectively with the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action, the MaManus Action and the Ingalls Action, the ""Federal Merger Litigation"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of November 19, 2010, as amended, and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. Each of the Federal Merger Litigation further alleges that (i) the Partnership's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2019 (the ""proxy statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. The Federal Merger Litigation seeks various remedies, including, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed, an order directing that the Board disseminates a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, an order directing defendants to account for all damages sustained, and an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Partnership believes that the claims asserted in the Federal Merger Litigation are without merit and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Federal Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Partnership has determined to voluntarily supplement the proxy statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Partnership specifically denies all allegations in the Federal Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

The Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action and the Luers Action each further alleges that (i) the Partnership's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Preliminary Proxy Statement.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""putative class action"" in multiple places, specifically in the context of the Curtis Action, Kent Action, and other related actions.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The mention of ""putative class action"" indeed states that the case of interest, specifically the Curtis Action (Case No. 4:19-cv-2147), is a putative class action.

Since the keyword search provides sufficient evidence, I will output ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" and the sentence containing ""class action"" as ""quote"".

The excerpts specifically state: ""On June 13, 2019, a purported unitholder of Buckeye filed a complaint in a putative class action...captioned Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated"". This aligns with the task instructions to confirm such mention and apply it to the target case.

3. **LLM Response's Conclusion:**

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the Merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to Buckeye's limited partnership agreement and its fiduciary duties to Buckeye's unitholders in agreeing to enter into the Merger Agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. The Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action and the McManus Action each further alleges that (i) Buckeye's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the Merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that Buckeye and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of Buckeye, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Preliminary Proxy Statement.

The Ingalls Action and the Riss Action each alleges that (i) Buckeye's definitive proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 25, 2019 (the ""Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the Merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that Buckeye and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of Buckeye, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Proxy Statement.

Item 8.01. | Other Events.

On May 10, 2019, Buckeye Partners, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Buckeye""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement"") with Hercules Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), Hercules Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (""ServiceCo""), and Buckeye GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the ""General Partner""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (the ""merger""), with the Partnership surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Parent.

Since the May 10, 2019 announcement of the merger agreement, six putative class action complaints and two individual complaints have been filed against Buckeye and the members of the board of directors of the General Partner (the ""Board""). The eight complaints are captioned as follows: Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (filed on June 13, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the ""Curtis Action""), Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128 (filed on June 18, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Kent Action""), John Greer v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (filed on June 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Greer Action""), Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (filed on June 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Luers Action""), Michael Weston, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01208 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Weston Action""), Heather McManus, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06000 (filed on June 26, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""McManus Action""), John Ingalls, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06098 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the ""Ingalls Action"") and Michael Riss, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01241 (filed on June 28, 2019 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the ""Riss Action"", collectively with the Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action, the Luers Action, the Weston Action, the MaManus Action and the Ingalls Action, the ""Federal Merger Litigation"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated as of November 19, 2010, as amended, and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. Each of the Federal Merger Litigation further alleges that (i) the Partnership's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2019 (the ""proxy statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. The Federal Merger Litigation seeks various remedies, including, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed, an order directing that the Board disseminates a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, an order directing defendants to account for all damages sustained, and an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

The Partnership believes that the claims asserted in the Federal Merger Litigation are without merit and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Federal Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Partnership has determined to voluntarily supplement the proxy statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Partnership specifically denies all allegations in the Federal Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Litigation Related to the Merger

(page 73)

On June 13, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, captioned Harry Curtis, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-2147 (the ""Curtis Action""). On June 18, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128 (the ""Kent Action""). On June 19, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned John Greer v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05741 (the ""Greer Action""). On June 20, 2019, a purported unitholder of the Partnership filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Anthony Luers v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-05767 (the ""Luers Action"").

The Curtis Action alleges, among other things, that in pursuing the merger, the Board breached its express and implied contractual duties pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement and its fiduciary duties to the unitholders of the Partnership in agreeing to enter into the merger agreement by means of an allegedly unfair process and for an allegedly unfair price. The Curtis Action, the Kent Action, the Greer Action and the Luers Action each further alleges that (i) the Partnership's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement""), omits material information with respect to the merger, rendering it false and misleading and, as a result, that the Partnership and the members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) the members of the Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient Preliminary Proxy Statement.

The Curtis Action seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, the disclosure of all material information concerning the merger, an order rescinding the consummation of the merger or an award of rescissory damages (in the event the merger is consummated), an award of damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

```",X1Q6O3LS4JO2,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down whether the LLM has hallucinated in its response based on the task instructions and the supporting excerpts.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""

The LLM correctly identified the term ""putative class action"" in the filing excerpts. Specifically, the case Michael Kent, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01128, is explicitly described as a ""putative class action"" in the excerpts.

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention

The LLM confirmed that the keyword ""putative class action"" directly pertains to the target case Michael Kent, v. Buckeye Partners, L.P., explicitly indicating that it is a class action. Therefore, the LLM's interpretation aligns with the information provided in the excerpts, meeting the criteria for confirming the class action status.

Consistency with Task Instructions

The LLM followed the instructions to first search for mentions of ""class action"" and confirmed that the mention pertains to the specific case of interest. The LLM correctly concluded that since the keyword search provides sufficient evidence for the class action status of the case, no further steps were necessary.

Final Determination

There are no contradictions or misinterpretations in the LLM's response. The mention of ""putative class action"" directly pertains to the target case, and the LLM's conclusion aligns perfectly with the task instructions.

Item 8.01. | Other Events.

The following disclosures supplement the disclosures contained in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, dated August 13, 2019 (the ""Proxy Statement""), which was filed by MidSouth Bancorp, Inc. (""MidSouth"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on August 13, 2019 and mailed on or about August 14, 2019 to MidSouth shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2019 in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition of MidSouth by Hancock Whitney Corporation (""Hancock Whitney""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), dated as of April 30, 2019, by and between MidSouth and Hancock Whitney, MidSouth will merge with and into Hancock Whitney (the ""Merger""), with Hancock Whitney continuing as the surviving entity.

On August 15, 2019, MidSouth received a letter on behalf of an alleged shareholder alleging that Midsouth and its directors violated their fiduciary duties and the federal securities laws by issuing allegedly misleading disclosures in connection with the Merger (the ""Parshall Demand""). Thereafter, another purported shareholder filed a separate putative class action complaint on August 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in an action captioned Raul v. MidSouth Bancorp, et al., 19-cv-07757 (the ""Raul Action""). Finally, another alleged MidSouth shareholder filed an action against MidSouth, its directors, and Hancock Whitney, captioned Delman v. MidSouth Bancorp, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019-5228 (the ""Delman Action"" and, together with the Parshall Demand and the Raul Action, the ""Actions""), in the 15th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafayette in Louisiana. The Actions generally allege that MidSouth and its directors violated the federal securities laws or breached duties under Louisiana state law by issuing allegedly misleading disclosures in connection with the Merger, that Hancock Whitney aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the individual defendants, and seek, among other things, to enjoin the shareholder vote scheduled for September 18, 2019 at which MidSouth shareholders will vote on a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

While MidSouth believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance, potential expense, and delay and to provide additional information to MidSouth's shareholders, MidSouth has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the below disclosures. In light of the supplemental disclosures, the Parshall Demand is being withdrawn and plaintiffs in the Raul Action and the Delman Action have agreed to dismiss their individual claims with prejudice. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth herein or in the Proxy Statement. To the contrary, MidSouth denies all allegations in the Actions that any additional disclosure was, or is, required.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""class action"" in the following sentence:

""Finally, another alleged MidSouth shareholder filed an action against MidSouth, its directors, and Hancock Whitney, captioned Delman v. MidSouth Bancorp, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019-5228 (the ""Delman Action"" and, together with the Parshall Demand and the Raul Action, the ""Actions""), in the 15th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafayette in Louisiana.""

However, this sentence does not explicitly state that the Delman Action is a class action. Instead, it is the Raul Action that is described as a ""putative class action complaint"" in a previous sentence:

""Another purported shareholder filed a separate putative class action complaint on August 20, 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in an action captioned Raul v. MidSouth Bancorp, et al., 19-cv-07757 (the ""Raul Action"").""

Since the keyword ""class action"" does not directly relate to the Delman Action, I will proceed to the next step.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I will look for explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, I did not find any such language in the excerpt that directly relates to the Delman Action.

3. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language that suggests the Delman Action is a class action, I will output ""No"" for ""is_class_action"".

Here is the JSON object:

    ""quote"": ""Not applicable"",

}",NOBLAW55269973,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down the LLM's response to assess if there was a hallucination:

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**:
   - In the excerpts, the phrase ""putative class action complaint"" does appear, but it is associated with the Raul Action, not the Delman Action.
   - The LLM correctly identifies that the sentence discussing the Delman Action does not explicitly state that it is a class action. Instead, it highlights that the Raul Action is a putative class action.

2. **Search for other keywords**:
   - The LLM searches for other keywords or phrases like ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" that suggest the case is a class action.
   - No such language is identified in the excerpts for the Delman Action. This analysis is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts.

3. **Assess negative**:
   - Since no evidence or keywords are found to suggest that the Delman Action is a class action, the LLM concludes ""No"" for ""is_class_action"", which is rational based on the information presented in the excerpts.

Analysis Conclusion:
- The LLM properly follows the task instructions by differentiating between cases mentioned in the excerpts.
- It adheres to the steps by evaluating and confirming that the class action keyword relates to a different case (Raul Action) and not the Target Case (Delman Action).
- The LLM response does not contain any fabricated information or misinterpretations and is accurate according to the given excerpts.

Based on the analysis, the LLM did not make any hallucinations.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**:

2. **Search for other keywords**:
   - The LLM looked for language indicating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The provided excerpts do not contain such language related to the Girardi Complaint, nor do they provide other language suggesting the case is a class action. This is consistent with the LLM's findings.

3. **Assess negative**:

On December 10, 2019, December 12, 2019 and December 23, 2019, respectively, three purported shareholders of the Company each filed an individual complaint against the Company and the members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases are captioned Shiva Stein v. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-11286, Harold Bonnikson v. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-11372, and Richard Liebman v. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-11766, respectively. On December 12, 2019, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a putative shareholder class action against the Company, the members of the Board, Advisor Group and Merger Sub in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The case is captioned Richard Scarantino v. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02266-UNA. On December 20, 2019, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a putative shareholder class action against the Company, the members of the Board, Advisor Group and Merger Sub in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The case is captioned Morris Akerman v. Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-07151.

All five complaints allege, among other things, that the individual defendants and the Company violated federal securities laws by disseminating a preliminary proxy statement that included allegedly material misstatements or omissions about the merger. Among other things, the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement omits or misrepresents material information concerning: (i) the Management Projections, (ii) the valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by Jefferies, (iii) the sales process and (iv) the potential conflicts of interest faced by the members of the Board and the executive officers of the Company. Each complaint seeks, among other things, (i) an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the merger until the allegedly omitted information is disclosed, (ii) rescission of the merger or an award of damages in the event the merger is consummated, and (iii) an award of plaintiff's attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to these complaints. The defendants believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations.

On December 20, 2019, Phillip Frost and Frost Nevada Investments Trust filed a complaint against the Company and the members of the Board contending that the Board's determination to enter into the merger agreement disregards obligations owed to them as holders of certain notes issued by the Company. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages, rescission of the transaction in which the plaintiffs sold a substantial portion of their shares of common stock to the Company, and an injunction against the merger. The Company believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend vigorously against these allegations.

However, this mention does not refer to the target case, which is ""Phillip Frost and Frost Nevada Investments Trust v. the Company and the members of the Board"".

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Since the keyword ""class action"" does not refer to the target case, I will proceed to the next step.

3. **Search for other keywords**: The document does not contain any explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" in the context of the target case.

4. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the target case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

```",NOBLAW84796331,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response:

Step 1: Analyzing Possible Contradictions and Misinterpretations

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: 
   - The LLM correctly identifies that there is a mention of ""class action"" in the filing excerpts: ""On December 12, 2019, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a putative shareholder class action against the Company, the members of the Board, Advisor Group, and Merger Sub in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.""
   - However, the LLM correctly notes that this mention does not pertain to the target case, which is ""Phillip Frost and Frost Nevada Investments Trust v. the Company and the members of the Board.""

2. **Confirm class action mention**: 
   - The LLM proceeds correctly, noting that since the class action mention does not refer to the target case, it should not be counted.

3. **Search for other keywords**: 
   - The LLM states that the document does not contain any explicit language indicating that the plaintiff in the target case is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" This is correct; the mention of ""putative shareholder class action"" pertains to another case, not the target case.

4. **Assess Negative**:

Under Tennessee law, neither the holders of shares of FB common stock nor Franklin common stock are entitled to appraisal or dissenters' rights under Chapter 23 of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (""TBCA"").

Litigation Related to the Merger

On April 8, 2020, a purported FB Financial stockholder filed a lawsuit against FB Financial and the members of the board of directors of FB Financial alleging violations of the directors' fiduciary duties with respect to the merger and the disclosures made in the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. The lawsuit is captioned Tomasulo v. Ayers., No. 20-0361-III, and is pending in the Chancery Court for the State of Tennessee 20th Judicial Division at Nashville.

The complaint generally alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to the merger at an allegedly inadequate price and following an allegedly insufficient process, including because the directors and J.P. Morgan, FB Financial's advisor, allegedly had financial interests in the merger. The complaint also alleges that the registration statement filed in connection with the merger of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of the board's duty of disclosure, including with regard to (i) FB Financial's financial advisor's ownership and trading of Franklin's stock; (ii) the advisory fees paid or payable to FB Financial's financial advisor; (iii) certain financial forecasts and dividend projections for Franklin that the Company instructed FB Financial's financial advisor to use in its financial analyses and details regarding certain of those certain financial analyses; and (iv) the estimated amount of and timing of cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger.

Plaintiffs seek to enjoin FB Financial from proceeding with the merger and seek damages in the event the merger is consummated. FB Financial believes that plaintiff's allegations are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and did not find any explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals.""

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: 
   - The LLM correctly identified that there are no explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or equivalent terms in the provided excerpts. This step was completed accurately.

2. **Search for other keywords**: 
   - The LLM was tasked with looking for language indicating that the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals.""

3. **Assess negative**: 
   - Since there are no mentions of ""class action"" or similar indicative language, the LLM correctly concluded that there is no evidence the case is a class action. The classification of ""No"" for ""is_class_action"" is appropriate based on the instructions.

In summary, the LLM followed the task instructions systematically and evaluated the content accurately without making any assertions beyond what was present in the provided excerpts.

2. **Confirm Class Action Mention:**
   - The LLM correctly recognizes that the keyword ""class action"" reference does not apply to the target case.

3. **Search for Other Keywords:**
   - The LLM examines the language concerning the target case, Dean Drulias v. CenterState Bank Corporation et al., and notes the absence of any mention of representation of a class or collective group.

4. **Assess Negative:**
   - The LLM concludes correctly that, since there is no evidence in the excerpts explicitly indicating the target case is a class action, the answer should be ""No.""

**Verification:**
- The excerpts provided do not describe the litigation concerning Dean Drulias v. CenterState Bank Corporation et al. as involving a class or collective claims.
- Therefore, the LLM's conclusion that the case is not a class action appears to be substantiated by the evidence provided.

```",X1Q6O7HI8HO2,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the response and the task instructions step by step.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""
The task's first step involves checking the document for mentions of ""class action"" or related terms. The LLM correctly noted that the excerpts contain no mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar phrases. 

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention
Since no keyword was found in Step 1, the LLM correctly skipped this step, as no confirmation could be made regarding the case being a class action through explicit mentions.

Step 3: Search for Other Keywords
The LLM looked for any other indications of class action status, such as language involving representation of ""similarly situated individuals."" The LLM found no such language in the excerpts concerning the Hirschbach lawsuit. The complaint was made by Hirschbach Motor Lines, Inc., a customer of Navistar, which suggests it's a direct business dispute rather than a class action involving a broad group.

Step 4: Assess Negative
Given the absence of keywords or suggestive language from the excerpts, the LLM concluded that this litigation case is not a class action. This conclusion aligns with its findings that there is no supporting information to label the case as a class action.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided content and the LLM's analysis, the LLM has accurately followed the task instructions. It rightly identified the lack of textual evidence supporting the notion that the Hirschbach v. Navistar case is a class action. Therefore, the LLM did not show any signs of hallucinating information in its analysis or final output.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and found that the keyword ""class action"" is mentioned in the following sentence:

However, this sentence does not refer to the target case, which is Don Johnston v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-03804.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Since the keyword ""class action"" does not refer to the target case, I will proceed to the next step.

3. **Search for other keywords**: I reviewed the document and found that the target case is described as follows:

""On May 15, 2020, a purported stockholder of Stemline filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Stemline and its directors, captioned Don Johnston v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-03804 (the ""Johnston Complaint"").""

There is no mention of the plaintiff representing a class or similarly situated individuals.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**:
   - The LLM identified a reference to a ""putative class action"" in the context of the Michael Leon v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. et al., (Case No. 1:20-cv-03931). This was correctly noted by the LLM as unrelated to the target case, which is Don Johnston v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., et al., (Case No. 1:20-cv-03804).

2. **Confirm class action mention**:
   - The LLM correctly proceeded to the next step since the ""class action"" keyword was not associated with the target case.

3. **Search for other keywords**:
   - The LLM examined the description of the target case and noted there is no language suggesting it is a class action, such as representing a class or similarly situated individuals.

4. **Assess negative**:
   - The LLM concluded that the document does not contain any suggestion that the target case is a class action, resulting in the correct evaluation that the case is not a class action.

Item 8.01. | Other Events.

On August 17, 2020, Analog Devices, Inc. (""ADI"") filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-248092) (as amended, the ""Form S-4"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") in connection with ADI's proposed acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Maxim"") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 12, 2020 (as it may be amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among ADI, Magneto Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of ADI (""Acquisition Sub"") and the Company. On September 4, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC its definitive joint proxy statement on Schedule 14A relating to the special meeting of stockholders of the Company scheduled to be held on October 8, 2020 (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement"") to, among other things, vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Since the initial filing of the Form S-4, six complaints (collectively, the ""Maxim Stockholder Complaints""), including two putative securities class action lawsuits, have been filed in federal courts in California, Delaware and New York by purported Maxim stockholders against Maxim and the members of the Maxim board of directors in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement: Shiva Stein v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:20-cv-05830 (N.D. Cal., filed August 18, 2020); Joseph Post v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:99-mc-09999 (D. Del., filed August 24, 2020) (the ""Post Action""); Waseem Khan v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-03982 (E.D.N.Y., filed August 26, 2020); Joseph Burns v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., No. 1:20-cv-07168 (S.D.N.Y., filed September 2, 2020); John Husselman v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-07525 (S.D.N.Y., filed September 14, 2020); and Joseph Schaffer v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:20-cv-06816 (N.D.Cal., filed September 30, 2020). The Post Action also names ADI and Acquisition Sub as defendants. In addition, one complaint, Coe Living Trust v. Analog Devices, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-11682 (D. Mass., filed September 11, 2020), has been filed by a purported ADI shareholder in federal court in Massachusetts against ADI and the members of the ADI board of directors (the ""Coe Action"" and, together with the Maxim Stockholder Complaints, the ""Federal Stockholder Complaints"") and one derivative lawsuit has been filed against the members of the ADI board of directors in state court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Mass. Sup. Ct., Norfolk Cnty., Case No. 20-0864, filed September 11, 2020) (the ""ADI State Action"" and, together with the Federal Stockholder Complaints, the ""Stockholder Actions""). Each of the Federal Stockholder Complaints alleges, among other things, that the Form S-4 omits material information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The ADI State Action alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims against ADI's directors in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including that the directors fraudulently concealed information based on allegations that the Form S-4 misrepresents or omits material information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The plaintiffs in the Federal Stockholder Complaints and the ADI State Action, among other things, seek to enjoin the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (and in two cases, to enjoin the shareholder vote) or, in the alternative, rescission of the merger or rescissionary damages, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

SUPPLEMENT TO DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT

This supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Definitive Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. Page references in the below disclosures are to pages in the Definitive Proxy Statement, and defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent the following information differs from or conflicts with the information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information set forth below shall be deemed to supersede the respective information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. The Company and ADI deny the allegations in the complaints related to the Stockholder Actions and deny any alleged violations of law or any legal or equitable duty. Without admitting in any way that the disclosures below are material or otherwise required by law, the Company and ADI make the following amended and supplemental disclosures solely for the purpose of mooting the allegations in the complaints related to the Stockholder Actions.

</target_case>
","To determine whether the target case, ADI State Action, is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and found that the term ""class action"" is mentioned in the context of two putative securities class action lawsuits filed in federal courts. However, these lawsuits are not related to the ADI State Action.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Since the mention of ""class action"" is related to other lawsuits and not the ADI State Action, this keyword hit does not count.

3. **Search for other keywords**: I searched for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, I did not find any such language in the context of the ADI State Action.

4. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the ADI State Action is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

1. **Search for the keyword ""class action""**: 
   - The LLM correctly identified that the term ""class action"" appears in the filing excerpts in relation to other lawsuits, specifically, ""two putative securities class action lawsuits"", but not in relation to the ADI State Action.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: 
   - The LLM appropriately assessed that since the ""class action"" keyword is linked to other lawsuits and not to the ADI State Action specifically, it does not apply.

3. **Search for other keywords**: 
   - The LLM searched for language that describes the plaintiff acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The excerpts do not provide such language related to the ADI State Action.

4. **Assess negative**:
   - Given the absence of any keywords or suggestive language regarding class action status for the ADI State Action, the LLM's conclusion that the case is not a class action is correctly supported by the excerpts.

**Final Assessment**:
- The analysis steps and logic followed by the LLM are in line with the task requirements.
- There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or diverging responses in the LLM's conclusion.
- The output JSON format is correct and in compliance with the task instructions, indicating ""No"" for ""is_class_action"".

Given these evaluations, the LLM has not made a hallucination in its response.

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

As previously disclosed in the ""Description of the Merger-Litigation Related to the Merger"" section of the definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on December 8, 2020 and first mailed to stockholders of Standard on December 14, 2020, on December 3, 2020, a purported stockholder of Standard filed a lawsuit against Standard and its directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Philip A. Pochinsky vs. Standard AVB Financial Corp., et al., Docket No. 1:20-cv-10176 (the ""Pochinsky Lawsuit""). The definitive proxy statement relates to the proposed merger (the ""merger"") of Standard with Dollar Acquisition Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dollar Mutual Bancorp (""Dollar""), pursuant to which Dollar will acquire Standard. The plaintiff generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by disclosing materially incomplete and misleading information about the merger to Standard stockholders. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, rescissory relief, unspecified damages and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

In addition, on December 16, 2020, another purported stockholder of Standard filed a lawsuit against Standard and its directors in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, captioned Lewis D. Baker vs. Standard AVB Financial Corp., et al., Index No. 657082/2020 (the ""Baker Lawsuit"" and together with the Pochinsky Lawsuit, the ""Merger Litigation""). The plaintiff generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by disclosing materially incomplete and misleading information about the merger to Standard stockholders. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, rescissory relief or damages, declarative relief, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

Solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, Standard has decided to make additional disclosures to supplement the disclosures contained in the definitive proxy statement (the ""Additional Disclosures""). The Additional Disclosures are set forth below and should be read in conjunction with the definitive proxy statement.

Standard believes that the Additional Disclosures moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims asserted in the Merger Litigation and, as a result, expects that the plaintiffs will decline to seek injunctive relief against the merger.

```",X1Q6O8BUVR82,TRUE,no hallucination,"To determine whether there is a hallucination in the LLM's response, we can analyze the task completion step by step:

Step 1: Analysis of Possible Contradictions and Misinterpretations

- The LLM was tasked with determining if the Target Case involved a class action. It correctly checked the provided filings for mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or any related terms.
- The LLM did not find any explicit mentions of these terms or any language typically indicating a class action, such as references to ""similarly situated individuals.""
- There is no explicit language suggesting the representative role of the plaintiffs for a class beyond ""purported stockholder,"" which the task instructions note as insufficient for determining a class action.
- The LLM correctly identifies that the lack of mentions precludes this case from being classified as a class action based solely on the information provided in the excerpts.

Step 2: Analysis of Divergence from Task Instructions

- The task instructions require a search for explicit or implicit indications that the case is a class action. The LLM followed this by first searching for keywords and then examining the context for any suggestive language.
- After finding no such indicators, the LLM assessed that there is no basis for concluding the case as a class action, which aligns with the criteria outlined in the task instructions for a ""No"" classification.

Conclusion on Hallucination:

- The LLM’s response does not exhibit any contradictions or misinterpretations of the information provided. It followed the task instructions methodically without deviation.
- Given that there are no discrepancies between the task requirements, the provided content, and the LLM's response, the LLM's determination that the case is not a class action seems accurate.

As previously disclosed, on December 14, 2020, TC PipeLines, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Partnership"" or ""TC PipeLines""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among TC Energy Corporation, a Canadian corporation (""TC Energy""), TC PipeLines GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the general partner of TC PipeLines, TransCan Northern Ltd., a Delaware corporation, TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation and TCP Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of TC Energy (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub into TC PipeLines (the ""Merger"") with TC PipeLines continuing as the surviving entity. As a result of the Merger, TC PipeLines will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy. On January 26, 2021, TC Energy and TC PipeLines filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement/prospectus for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the special meeting of TC PipeLines' unitholders to be held on February 26, 2021, to vote upon, among other things, matters necessary to complete the Merger (the ""Proxy Statement/Prospectus"").

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, 7 complaints have been filed with respect to the Merger as of February 17, 2021: three in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned as Foti v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-00828 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Foti Action""), Zajac v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-01047 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Zajac Action"") and Wilhelm v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-01204 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Wilhelm Action""); one in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned as Walters v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-00675 (E.D.N.Y.) (the ""Walters Action""); two in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned as Waterman v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-00122-UNA (D. Del.) (the ""Waterman Action"") and Stein v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 1:21-cv-00159-UNA (the ""Stein Action"" and, together with the Foti Action, Zajac Action, Wilhelm Action, Walters Action and Waterman Action ""the Federal Court Actions""); and one in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York, captioned as Veltri v. TC PipeLines, LP et al, No. 650692/2021 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty) (the ""Veltri Action"" and together with the Federal Court Actions, the ""Unitholder Actions""). The Unitholder Actions were filed by purported TC PipeLines unitholders and name TC PipeLines, TC PipeLines GP, Inc. and the members of the board of directors of TC PipeLines GP, Inc. as defendants.

The Unitholder Actions allege, among other things, that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act. The Unitholder Actions seek injunctive relief enjoining the Merger and damages and costs, among other remedies.

It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above may be amended. If this occurs, TC PipeLines and TC Energy do not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains materially new or different allegations. Although TC PipeLines and TC Energy cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from these matters, TC PipeLines, TC Energy and TC PipeLines GP, Inc.'s defendant directors believe that these complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend them.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the Merger, seven lawsuits were filed between November 23 and December 28, 2020 against one or more of Concho, the directors of Concho, ConocoPhillips, the directors of ConocoPhillips and Merger Sub (collectively, the ""Defendants""). Four complaints, Stein v. Concho Resources Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-01582-UNA, Chappidi v. Concho Resources Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-01584-UNA, Lovoi v. ConocoPhillips et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-01638-UNA and Davydov v. ConocoPhillips et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-01674-UNA (the ""Davydov lawsuit""), were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. One complaint, Ortiz v. Concho Resources Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-05886, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. One complaint, Stracener v. ConocoPhillips et al., C.A. No. 1:20-cv-10954, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. One complaint, Garfield v. Bunch et al., No. 2020-79700, was filed in the District Court of Harris County, Texas (the ""Garfield lawsuit"").

The complaints filed in federal court generally allege, among other things, that the Defendants disseminated a false or misleading registration statement regarding the proposed Merger in violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. These complaints allege that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus or the Definitive Proxy Statement filed by ConocoPhillips misstated or omitted material information regarding the parties' financial projections, the analyses performed by Concho's and ConocoPhillips' respective financial advisors, potential conflicts of interest involving Concho's and ConocoPhillips' respective financial advisors and/or the sales process leading up to the Merger, and that disclosure of material information is necessary for Concho's and ConocoPhillips' stockholders to make informed decisions regarding whether to vote in favor of the Merger or the issuance of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in connection with the Merger (the ""Share Issuance""). Other than the Davydov lawsuit, the complaints further allege that Concho's or ConocoPhillips' directors and/or ConocoPhillips are liable for alleged violations as ""controlling persons"" of Concho and ConocoPhillips under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Garfield lawsuit alleges, among other things, that ConocoPhillips and the directors of ConocoPhillips disseminated a Definitive Proxy Statement that contains materially false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of Texas common law. The complaint alleges that the Definitive Proxy Statement included false or misleading statements regarding conflicts of interests of those promoting the Merger, as well as financial information underlying the analyses conducted by ConocoPhillips' financial advisor in formulating its fairness opinion, and that disclosure of material information is necessary for ConocoPhillips' stockholders to make informed decisions regarding whether to vote in favor of the Share Issuance. Among other relief, the complaints seek injunctive relief, including enjoining the Merger unless and until the Defendants disclose the allegedly omitted material information, rescinding the Merger in the event the Defendants consummate the Merger (or awarding rescissory damages), damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. ConocoPhillips and Concho believe that the claims in the complaints are without merit and that no further disclosure is required under applicable law.

As a result of supplemental disclosures set forth herein, the plaintiff in the Garfield lawsuit has entered into an agreement to voluntarily dismiss his action with prejudice.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""
- The LLM correctly identified that there were no explicit mentions of the terms ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or other similar terms in the provided excerpts. This observation aligns with the task instructions to first search for these specific terms.

Step 2: Search for Other Keywords
- The LLM looked for language indicating the plaintiff acting on behalf of ""similarly situated individuals"" and found no such language. The complaint discussion mainly focused on allegations about misleading statements and omissions relating to the merger, without indicating class representation.
- This aligns with the instructions to look for keywords that might suggest a class action, finding nothing to suggest that the case involved representation of a group or class.

Step 3: Assess Negative
- Based on the absence of any class action language or suggestion in the excerpts, the LLM concluded that the case is not a class action.
- This correctly follows the task's negative assessment protocol when no evidence of class action is found.

- The LLM's response did not include any contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergence from the task instructions.
- The evaluation steps taken by the LLM were consistent with the process outlined in the task instructions, and the JSON output was accurately formatted based on the findings of no class action indications.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of operations, the Company and the Bank may be involved in various legal proceedings that the Company believes is of such types common to our industry. There are currently two lawsuits in which the Company is a defendant.

On April 9, 2021, a lawsuit was filed by a purported shareholder of the Company in the Circuit Court of Bourbon County, Kentucky challenging our proposed merger with Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. The complaint, captioned Paul Parshall v. Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. et al. (Case No. 21-CI-00109), names as defendants the Company, the Company's board of directors, Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (""Stock Yards Bancorp"") and H. Meyer Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stock Yards Bancorp (""Merger Sub""). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties as directors of the Company in connection with their consideration and approval of the proposed merger transaction and caused materially misleading and incomplete information regarding the proposed transaction to be disseminated to the Company shareholders in violation of their fiduciary duty of disclosure. The complaint further asserts that the Company, Stock Yards Bancorp and Merger Sub aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors of the Company in connection with the proposed transaction. The complaint seeks, among other relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing the defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the proposed transaction unless and until the Company provides all material information to the Company shareholders to allow them to make a fully informed voting or appraisal decision with respect to the proposed transaction and adopts and implements a procedure or process to obtain a merger agreement providing the best available terms for the Company shareholders. Stock Yards Bancorp, the Company and the Company's board of directors believe the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit. On April 28, 2021, Stock Yards Bancorp and Merger Sub, with the consent of the other defendants, filed a Notice of Removal with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, Central Division, to remove the case from Bourbon Circuit Court to the U.S. District Court (Case No. 5:21-CV-00108-REW) for all further proceedings.

On April 30, 2021, a lawsuit was filed by a purported shareholder of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging our proposed merger with Stock Yards Bancorp. The complaint, captioned Alex Ciccotelli v. Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-CV-03865-LAP), names as defendants the Company, the Company's board of directors, Stock Yards Bancorp and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""1934 Act"") and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by disseminating a proxy statement/prospectus to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the proposed transaction that contains material misstatements and omissions and that the Company is liable as the issuer of those statements. The complaint further asserts that the individual defendants and Stock Yards Bancorp are liable for the alleged misstatements and omissions in the proxy statement/prospectus by virtue of their actions as controlling persons of the Company within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act.

The complaint seeks, among other relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing the defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the proposed transaction, an order directing the individual defendants to disseminate a proxy statement/prospectus that does not contain any material misstatements or omissions and, in the event defendants consummate the proposed transaction, an award of rescissionary damages. Stock Yards Bancorp, the Company and the Company's board of directors believe the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and did not find any explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, I did not find any such language in the excerpt. The complaint mentions that the lawsuit was filed by a ""purported shareholder of the Company,"" but this does not necessarily imply that the case is a class action.

3. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

Here is the output in JSON format:

    ""is_class_action"": ""No"",
    ""note"": ""No mention of class action or representation of similarly situated individuals""
}
```",NOBLAW39423013,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""
The task instructions first direct us to search for explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms. The LLM states it did not find any such mentions in the document, which is consistent with the excerpts provided. There is indeed no mention of the term ""class action"" within the provided SEC filing excerpts.

Step 2: Search for Other Keywords
Next, we search for alternative language suggesting representation of a class, such as ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The LLM accurately notes that there is no such language within the provided excerpts. The target case description only indicates ""a purported shareholder of the Company"" filing for a lawsuit, which doesn't imply class action status.

Step 3: Assess Negative
The final step involves concluding whether the excerpt suggests a class action based on the absence of relevant keywords or language in Steps 1 and 2. The LLM deduces that the case is not a class action, by rightly identifying the absence of any keywords or suggestive language. Thus, the conclusion ""No"" for ""is_class_action"" is correct.

Final Assessment
Based on the analysis, there are no evident contradictions, misinterpretations, or deviations from the task instructions. The LLM accurately followed each step of the instruction and correctly concluded that the provided content does not describe a class action. Therefore, the LLM's response is free from hallucination.

Two additional disclosure complaints were filed by purported stockholders of MSG Networks in federal district courts (together with the MSGN NY Federal Actions, the ""MSGN Federal Actions""). On June 25, 2021, a complaint captioned Patrick Plumley v. MSG Networks Inc. et al., 21-cv-00909, was filed by a purported stockholder of MSG Networks in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. On June 28, 2021, a complaint captioned Matthew Whitfield v. MSG Networks Inc. et al., 21-cv-02868, was filed by a purported stockholder of MSG Networks in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaints are similar. The complaints name MSG Networks and the MSG Networks' board members as defendants and allege that the Definitive Proxy Statement is materially incomplete and misleading in violation of the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose material information allegedly omitted from the Definitive Proxy Statement, rescission of the Merger Agreement to the extent already implemented (or awarding of rescissory damages), damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 27, 2021, a complaint captioned Hollywood Firefighters' Pension Fund et al. v. James Dolan, et al., 2021-0468-KSJM, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of MSG Entertainment against MSG Entertainment, the MSG Entertainment board of directors, certain Dolan family stockholders and MSG Networks. The complaint purports to allege derivative claims on behalf of MSG Entertainment and claims on behalf of a putative class of MSG Entertainment stockholders concerning the proposed merger. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Merger is a business combination with an interested stockholder that is not allowed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the ""DGCL""), that the MSG Entertainment board members and majority stockholders violated their fiduciary duties in agreeing to the proposed Merger, and that the disclosures herein relating to the Merger are misleading or incomplete. Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the stockholder vote and consummation of the Merger, and an award of damages in the event the transaction is consummated and plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. On June 15, 2021, plaintiffs filed a brief in support of its motion seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the MSG Entertainment stockholder vote and consummation of the Merger, which defendants have opposed. The preliminary injunction hearing was held by the Court of Chancery on July 1, 2021, and a decision of the Court is expected before the stockholders' vote on July 8, 2021.

On June 1, 2021, a complaint captioned Cody Laidlaw v. James Dolan et al., No. 606861-2021, was filed by a purported stockholder of MSG Entertainment in the New York Supreme Court (Nassau County). The complaint names MSG Entertainment and the MSG Entertainment board members as defendants and alleges that the MSG Entertainment board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the transaction and that the proxy for the proposed Merger filed on June 4, 2021 is materially incomplete and misleading. The complaint seeks, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose material information allegedly omitted from the registration statement, an award of compensatory or rescissory damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. On June 14, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to enjoin the July 8, 2021 stockholder vote in the absence of supplemental disclosures. On June 30, 2021, this action was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.

On June 9, 2021, a complaint captioned Timothy Leisz v. MSG Networks Inc. et al., 2021-0504-KSJM, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by a purported stockholder of MSG Networks against MSG Networks, the MSG Networks board, certain Dolan family stockholders and MSG Entertainment. The complaint purports to allege claims on behalf of a putative class of MSG Networks stockholders concerning the proposed Merger. The MSG Networks plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the Merger is a business combination with an interested stockholder that is not allowed under Section 203 of the DGCL, that the MSG Networks board members and majority stockholders violated their fiduciary duties in agreeing to the proposed merger, and that the disclosures relating to the merger are misleading or incomplete. Plaintiff seeks, among other relief, declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the stockholder vote and consummation of the Merger, and an award of damages in the event the transaction is consummated and plaintiff's attorneys' fees. On June 21, 2021, plaintiff filed a brief in support of his motion seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the MSG Networks stockholder vote and consummation of the Merger, which defendants have opposed. The preliminary injunction hearing was held by the Court of Chancery on July 1, 2021, and a decision of the Court is expected before the stockholders' vote on July 8, 2021.

MSG Entertainment and MSG Networks believe that the claims in these actions are without merit and that no further disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the MSGN Federal Actions and the Laidlaw action delaying or adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the costs, risks, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, MSG Entertainment and MSG Networks have determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, MSG Entertainment and MSG Networks specifically deny all allegations in the MSGN Federal Actions and the Laidlaw action that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Holders of WRI common shares are entitled to dissenters' rights under Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC, provided they satisfy the special conditions and conditions set forth therein. For a more detailed discussion of your dissenters' rights and the requirements for perfecting your dissenters' rights, see ""Dissenters' Rights of WRI Shareholders."" In addition, a copy of Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC is attached as Appendix E to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Beginning on May 28, 2021, two purported holders of WRI common shares filed substantially similar complaints against WRI and the members of the WRI board of trust managers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. One of these suits also names Kimco. The complaints are captioned as follows: Stein v. Weingarten Realty Investors et al., No. 1:21-cv-04806 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 28, 2021); and Waterman v. Weingarten Realty Investors et al., No. 1:21-cv-04970 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 4, 2021). The complaints variously assert, among other things, claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against WRI and the members of the WRI board of trust managers and claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of the WRI board of trust managers (and in one case Kimco) for allegedly causing a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed on May 28, 2021 with the SEC. In addition, beginning on June 7, 2021, two purported holders of Kimco common stock filed substantially similar complaints against Kimco and the members of the Kimco board of directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, respectively. The complaints are captioned as Fields v. Kimco Realty Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-03198 (E.D.N.Y. filed June 7, 2021); and Nayak v. Kimco Realty Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-05501 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 23, 2021). The complaints assert, among other things, claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against Kimco and the members of the Kimco board of directors and claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of the Kimco board of directors for allegedly causing a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed on May 28, 2021 with the SEC. In addition, on June 21, 2021, a purported holder of Kimco common stock filed a complaint against Kimco and the members of the Kimco board of directors in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of Westchester. The complaint is captioned as Garfield v. Cooper et al (NY Sup. Ct. filed June 21, 2021). The complaint asserts, among other things, claims for breach of fiduciary duty under Maryland law as well as fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and concealment under New York common law against Kimco and its board of directors. The complaint alleges that Kimco and its board of directors caused a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed on May 28, 2021 with the SEC. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger.

If any case is not resolved, the lawsuit(s) could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in costs to Kimco and WRI. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected time frame. Other potential plaintiffs may file additional lawsuits against Kimco, WRI and/or the directors, trust managers and officers of either company in connection with the Merger.

Litigation Related to the Merger

As previously disclosed in the Definitive Proxy Statement, at that time, three lawsuits had been filed in connection with the Merger between May 27, 2021 and June 9, 2021 against one or more of Knoll, the directors of Knoll, Herman Miller and Merger Sub (the ""Defendants""). Two complaints, Stein v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:21-cv-04759 and Waterman v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:21-cv-05119 (the ""Waterman lawsuit""), were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. One complaint, Gatto v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 2:21-cv-12287, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC, an additional six lawsuits were filed in connection with the Merger between June 15, 2021 and June 30, 2021 against one or more of the Defendants. One complaint, Snitkoff v. Andringa et al., C.A. No. 21-6529CB (the ""Snitkoff lawsuit""), was filed in the 20th Circuit Court for the State of Michigan; one complaint, Strickland v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:21-cv-05346, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; two complaints, O'Neill v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:21-cv-12741, and Martinez v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 2:21-cv-13144, were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; one complaint, Coffman v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 1:21-cv-00873-UNA, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; and one complaint, Whitfield v. Knoll, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 2:21-cv-02776 (the ""Whitfield lawsuit""), was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

The complaints filed in federal court generally allege, among other things, that Knoll and the directors of Knoll, and, in the case of the Waterman lawsuit and the Whitfield lawsuit, Herman Miller, and Merger Sub, disseminated or controlled the dissemination of a false or misleading registration or proxy statement regarding the proposed Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, such complaints allege that the registration statement filed by Herman Miller on May 24, 2021 in connection with the Merger and/or the Definitive Proxy Statement were inaccurate or misleading, including in respect of the disclosures concerning the parties' financial projections and the analyses performed by Knoll's financial advisor in support of its fairness opinion, and omitted material information concerning the sales process leading up to the Merger and potential conflicts of interest involving Knoll's financial advisor. The complaints further allege that the directors of Knoll and, in the case of the Waterman lawsuit and the Whitfield lawsuit, Herman Miller and Merger Sub, are liable for these violations as ""controlling persons"" of Knoll under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

The Snitkoff lawsuit, the sole complaint filed in state court, alleges, among other things, that the directors of Herman Miller breached their state law fiduciary duties by approving the Merger and in disseminating materially incomplete disclosures. The alleged material misstatements and omissions relate to, among other topics, the opinion of Herman Miller's financial advisor, potential conflicts of interest involving the directors of Herman Miller and Herman Miller's financial advisor, and certain background events that occurred in connection with the Merger.

2. **Search for other keywords**: The LLM searched for explicit language indicating representation ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" but did not find any such language related to the target case, Dean Drulias vs. Independent Bank Corp., et al.

3. **Assess negative**: The LLM concluded there is no evidence to suggest the case is a class action, as the necessary keywords and language are absent.

Analysis:
- The LLM followed the instructions systematically, checking for direct mentions of ""class action"" and similar terms, and then looking for language that might indicate the case was brought on behalf of others similarly situated.
- It correctly assessed that the provided excerpts do not contain any such keywords or indications with respect to the target case, Dean Drulias vs. Independent Bank Corp., et al.
- The LLM’s conclusion that the case is not a class action is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts.

Since the LLM's response accurately reflects the task instructions and provided content, it did not hallucinate.

Item 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

This Current Report on Form 8-K discloses certain additional information relating to the anticipated merger of Cimarex Energy Co. (""Cimarex"") with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (""Cabot""). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), dated as of May 23, 2021, as amended on June 29, 2021, by and among Cimarex, Cabot and Double C Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Cabot (""Merger Sub""), Merger Sub will merge with and into Cimarex (the ""Merger"").

In connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, ten putative stockholders of Cimarex filed separate lawsuits against Cimarex and the Cimarex board. Five of the lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and are captioned Wang v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-05672, Graff v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-05804, Elliot v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06315, Lukosevicius v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06568 and Jones v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-07798; two of the lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and are captioned Sheridan v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01290 and Parshall v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01311; one of the lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, and is captioned Woodyard v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01850; one of the lawsuits was filed in the Colorado District Court of Denver County, Colorado, and is captioned Garfield v. Jorden, et al., Case No. 2021CV32655; and one of the lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and is captioned Ciccotelli v. Cimarex, et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-04113. Each of the actions is asserted only on behalf of the named plaintiff. In general, the complaints assert claims alleging, among other things, that Cimarex and the Cimarex board failed to make adequate disclosures in Cimarex's proxy statement relating to the Merger (in its definitive form, the ""Proxy Statement""). Cimarex believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit.

While Cimarex believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay, and to provide additional information to Cimarex's stockholders, Cimarex has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth herein or in the Proxy Statement. To the contrary, Cimarex denies all allegations in the litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

The Ali Group Merger Cases

Welbilt was a named defendant in eight separate litigations (collectively, the ""Ali Group Cases"") arising in connection with a Proxy Statement that Welbilt filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 in connection with the merger between Welbilt and Ali Group.

On August 20, 2021, Catherine Nichols, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Nichols v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 25, 2021, the Plaintiff in the Stein litigation filed an amended complaint in the lawsuit titled Stein v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Also on August 25, 2021, Sarah Vanmersbergen, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Vanmersbergen v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On September 8, 2021, Rodrigo Chapa, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Chapa v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On September 9, 2021, Richard Lawrence, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Lawrence v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. On September 10, 2021, the Plaintiff in the Wietschner litigation filed an amended complaint in the lawsuit titled Wietschner v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Also on September 10, 2021, Brian Jones, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Jones v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On September 16, 2021, Jordan Wilson, a purported stockholder of Welbilt, filed a lawsuit titled Wilson v. Welbilt, Inc. et al. against Welbilt and certain members of Welbilt's Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

The plaintiffs in all eight of the Ali Group Cases alleged that the Defendants purportedly violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and SEC Rule 14a-9, because the Proxy Statement that was filed with the SEC, and disseminated to Welbilt's stockholders, was materially incomplete and misleading.

Plaintiffs in the Wietschner, Chapa, Lawrence, Jones, Nichols and Wilson litigations have since voluntarily dismissed their lawsuits. The Stein and Vanmersbergen litigations are currently pending.

Welbilt is currently a named defendant in seven separate litigations (collectively, the ""Ali Group Cases"") arising in connection with a Proxy Statement that Welbilt filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 in connection with the merger between Welbilt and Ali Group.

On August 25, 2021, the Plaintiff in the Stein litigation filed an amended complaint in the lawsuit titled Stein v.

The Plaintiffs in all seven of the Ali Group Cases allege that the Defendants purportedly violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 14a-9, because the Proxy Statement that was filed with the SEC, and disseminated to Welbilt's stockholders, was materially incomplete and misleading. Plaintiffs in the Ali Group Cases also seek to enjoin Defendants from taking any steps to consummate the merger with Ali Group unless and until certain material information is disclosed to Welbilt's stockholders, or in the event the proposed merger is consummated, to recover damages resulting from Defendants' purported violations of the Exchange Act. Welbilt has yet to be served in any of the Ali Group Cases.

We intend to defend vigorously against the Ali Group Cases and all lawsuits as they may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and are unable to estimate the range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We also cannot provide any assurance that the ultimate resolution of any lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the proposed merger with Ali Group or our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Step 1: Search for keyword ""class action""
The LLM correctly states it reviewed the excerpts for explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms and found none. The excerpts provided do not contain these keywords; therefore, this examination is accurate.

Step 2: Search for other keywords
The LLM correctly checks for any language stating that the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The excerpts mention that the plaintiffs are ""purported stockholders,"" but this does not suggest that they are representing a larger class of individuals. There is no misinterpretation as plaintiffs being referred to as ""purported stockholders"" does not imply class action status.

Step 3: Assess negative
The LLM appropriately concludes that the lack of keywords or language indicating a class action suggests that the case is not classified as a class action. The LLM's decision to classify the case as ""No"" for ""is_class_action"" follows logically from the information provided in the excerpts.

Overall, the LLM's analysis and conclusion align with the task instructions and available data. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences observed. The LLM correctly adheres to the instructions and formulates a response based on the evidence provided.

As previously disclosed and reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 21, 2021 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), Raven Industries, Inc., a South Dakota corporation (the ""Company"" or ""Raven""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), dated as of June 20, 2021, with CNH Industrial N.V., a Netherlands public limited liability company (""CNH Industrial""), and CNH Industrial South Dakota, Inc., a South Dakota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial (""Merger Subsidiary""), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the ""Merger""). As a result of the Merger, Merger Subsidiary will cease to exist, and the Company will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial.

On August 6, 2021, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement in connection with the Merger (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement""). As disclosed in the Definitive Proxy Statement, as of August 6, 2021, three purported stockholders of Raven had filed actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the ""Preliminary Proxy Complaints""), captioned Stein v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06215 (S.D.N.Y.), Hopkins v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06363 (S.D.N.Y.) and Maluga v. Raven Industries, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06636 (S.D.N.Y.), alleging that a preliminary version of the proxy statement filed with the SEC on July 19, 2021 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") was materially incomplete, false or misleading in certain respects, thereby allegedly violating Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § § 78n(a), 78t(a)), and SEC Rule 14a-9 (17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9) or 17 C.F.R. § 244.100 promulgated thereunder.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement and prior to the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, five additional complaints have been filed as individual actions in United States District Courts and one complaint has been filed in South Dakota state court (the ""Definitive Proxy Complaints"" and, collectively, with the Preliminary Proxy Complaints, the ""Complaints""). The Complaints are filed as individual actions against the Company and its directors. The state court Complaint also asserts its claims against CNH Industrial and the Merger Subsidiary. Two Definitive Proxy Complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and are captioned Chaney v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-06953 and Cohen v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-07383. Two of the Definitive Proxy Complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado and are captioned Taylor v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02321 and Reinhardt v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02323. One Definitive Proxy Complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Ciccotelli v. Raven Industries, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-03874. One Definitive Proxy Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for the Second Judicial District of the State of South Dakota, Minnehaha County, and is captioned Garfield v. Andriga, et al., Case No. 49CIV21-002169.

The Complaints generally allege that the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, failed to disclose material information in connection with the Merger and that, as a result, the Preliminary Proxy Statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, is materially misleading in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act or Section 20-10-1 and Section 20-10-2 of the South Dakota Codified Laws. The state court Complaint asserts additional claims for breach of fiduciary duties and misrepresentation under South Dakota statutory and common law. The Complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the Company from consummating the Merger or, in the alternative, rescission of the Merger or damages. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger may also be filed in the future.

The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the above captioned actions delaying or adversely affecting the Merger, to alleviate the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, to provide additional information to its stockholders, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has determined voluntarily to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement as described in this supplemental disclosure. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein.

**1. Search for Keyword ""Class Action"":**
   - The LLM correctly identified that the provided excerpts do not explicitly mention ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms. Therefore, based on the task instructions, there is no direct evidence to confirm the case as a class action.

**2. Search for Other Keywords:**
   - The LLM searched for phrases like ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals,"" which could imply a class action even if explicitly unmentioned. The excerpts have no such phrases.
   - The mention of ""purported stockholders"" is present, but as the LLM correctly noted, this does not imply a class action as per the guidelines provided in the instructions.

**3. Assess Negative:**
   - The LLM followed the instructions to output ""No"" for ""is_class_action"" since neither ""class action"" nor language indicative of a class-action status is found in excerpts. This aligns with step 4 of the thinking instructions, which directs a ""No"" in such cases.

**Conclusion:**
- **Contradictions and Misinterpretations:** The LLM accurately interpreted the information in the provided excerpts, correctly navigating through the steps to reach a decision that aligns with the task instructions.

These complaints generally allege, among other things, that the Proxy Statement fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections of Hillrom, (ii) certain financial analyses of Hillrom's financial advisors, and (iii) certain statements regarding the process leading up to Hillrom's entry into the Merger Agreement. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, to enjoin Hillrom from consummating the Merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney's fees.

A demand letter was also sent to Hillrom by a purported Hillrom shareholder on October 26, 2021, alleging similar deficiencies in the Proxy Statement as those noted in the above-referenced complaints.

Additionally, on October 27, 2021, a purported Hillrom shareholder filed suit against Hillrom, Baxter, and the current members of the Hillrom Board asserting violations of Illinois state law based on allegedly misleading statements and omissions in the Proxy Statement. The lawsuit, captioned Garfield v. Dempsey, et al., Case No. 2021CH05430, is pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, and seeks, among other things, to enjoin Hillrom from holding the shareholder vote to approve the Merger.

Hillrom believes that the claims asserted in the above-described actions are without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to moot the unmeritorious disclosure claims, to avoid the risk of the above-described actions delaying or adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Hillrom has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, Hillrom specifically denies all allegations in the above-referenced actions, including allegations that any additional disclosure was or is required, and believes that the supplemental disclosures contained herein are immaterial.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into JMP, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease, and the Company will be the surviving company as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Citizens (the ""Merger"").

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding common share of JMP (other than (i) shares owned by JMP or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JMP, (ii) shares owned by Citizens or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citizens, in each case, excluding shares held on behalf of third parties, and, (iii) shares for which appraisal rights have been properly exercised and perfected under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the JMP LLC Agreement) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash consideration of $7.50 (the ""Merger Consideration""). The Merger is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of JMP shareholder approval, governmental and regulatory approvals, and other usual and customary closing conditions. However, no assurance can be given as to when, or if, the merger will occur.

Following the filing of JMP's preliminary proxy statement associated with the Merger with the SEC on October 5, 2021, six (6) complaints have been filed against JMP and certain officers and directors thereof in connection with the Merger, each filed in a United States District Court, as follows: Shiva Stein v. JMP Group LLC, et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-07877 (N.D. Cal.) (filed Oct. 7, 2021); Claude Carrick v. JMP Group, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08415 (S.D.N.Y.) (filed Oct. 12, 2021); Kevin Anderson v. JMP Group LLC, et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-05911 (E.D.N.Y.) (filed Oct. 25, 2021); Stephen Bushansky v. JMP Group, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08318 (N.D. Cal.) (filed Oct. 26, 2021) (N.D. Cal.); Jack Wolf v. JMP Group, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01510 (D. Del.) (filed Oct. 26, 2021); and Jordan Wilson v. JMP Group, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08916 (S.D.N.Y.) (filed Oct. 31, 2021). The complaints (collectively, the ""Merger Complaints"") allege that the preliminary proxy statement or the Proxy Statement (as defined below) misstates or omits material information with respect to the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""). The Merger Complaints seek, among other things, injunctive and declaratory relief preventing the consummation of the Merger pending dissemination of a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact, rescission of the Merger if consummated or an award of rescissory damages, an award of compensatory damages, and an award of plaintiffs' expenses and attorneys' fees. In addition, counsel for two shareholders delivered demand letters to the Company, which threatened the filing of similar lawsuits.

On October 15, 2021, JMP filed the definitive merger proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"").

JMP and the individual defendants believe that JMP has previously disclosed all information required to be disclosed to ensure that its shareholders can make an informed vote at the Special Meeting (as defined below) and that the additional disclosures requested by the plaintiffs are not required by the federal securities laws or Delaware law, and are otherwise immaterial. Accordingly, JMP and the individual defendants believe the claims asserted in the Merger Complaints are without merit. However, in order to reduce the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, JMP has determined voluntarily to supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K (the ""Report""). Nothing in this Report shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, JMP and the JMP board of directors specifically deny all allegations in the Merger Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

- There is no reference to this case being a class action in the excerpts provided. There are no phrases or keywords suggesting a representative of other similarly situated individuals in the context of the listed lawsuits.

2022-01-10 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1613665/000114036122001173/brhc10032701_8k.htm]:
As previously announced, on September 15, 2021, Great Western Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Great Western"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement"") with First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., a Montana corporation (""First Interstate""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Great Western will merge with and into First Interstate (the ""Merger""), with First Interstate continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Great Western and First Interstate.

In connection with the Merger, First Interstate filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement on Form S-4 containing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, as amended, and each of Great Western and First Interstate filed a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC dated December 16, 2021 (the ""Proxy Statement""), which Great Western and First Interstate first mailed to their stockholders and shareholders, respectively, on or about December 16, 2021.

Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, a complaint (the ""Complaint""), captioned Laidlaw v. Borrecco et al., No. 49CIV21-003213, was filed by a purported stockholder of Great Western in the Circuit Court of the 2nd Judicial District, Minnehaha County, South Dakota. In addition, Great Western received demand letters from counsel representing individual stockholders of Great Western (the ""Demand Letters"" and, together with the Complaint, the ""Matters""). The Matters allege, among other things, that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement relating to the Merger to be filed with the SEC in violation of certain state securities laws, Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and/or in breach of their fiduciary obligations under state law.

Great Western and First Interstate believe the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Matters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Great Western and First Interstate have agreed to supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Great Western, First Interstate and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to Great Western's stockholders or First Interstate's shareholders, as applicable. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, Great Western and First Interstate specifically deny all allegations in the Matters that any additional disclosure was or is required.

The additional disclosures in this Current Report on Form 8-K supplement the disclosures contained in the Proxy Statement and should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. To the extent that information herein differs from or updates information contained in the Proxy Statement, the information contained herein supersedes the information contained in the Proxy Statement. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class or series of stock if such shares of stock, or depositary receipts in respect thereof, are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders, unless the stockholders receive in exchange for their shares anything other than shares of stock of the surviving or resulting corporation (or depositary receipts in respect thereof), or of any other corporation that is publicly listed or held by more than 2,000 holders of record, cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depositary receipts described above or any combination of the foregoing. Because Great Western common stock is listed on the NYSE, a national securities exchange, and because Great Western stockholders will receive in the merger only shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, which will be publicly listed on NASDAQ upon the effective time, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, the holders of Great Western common stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Litigation Related to the Merger

On November 30, 2021, a complaint, captioned Laidlaw v. Borrecco et al., No. 49CIV21-003213, was filed by a purported stockholder of Great Western in the Circuit Court of the 2nd Judicial District, Minnehana County, South Dakota. The complaint names First Interstate, Great Western and the Great Western board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and concealment under South Dakota law relating to the disclosures made in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The complaint seeks, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the merger, rescission of the merger if it is consummated, damages and an award of plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees. First Interstate and Great Western believe the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby may be filed in the future. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, neither First Interstate nor Great Western will necessarily announce such additional filings.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""class action""
The LLM accurately noted the absence of explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms in the provided excerpts. This step is performed correctly as the excerpts did not include these keywords.

Step 2: Search for Other Keywords
The LLM searched for language indicating the plaintiff acts ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" and found none. The LLM also realized that the inclusion of ""purported stockholder"" does not imply a class action, aligning with the guidelines of the task instructions.

Step 3: Assess Negative
The LLM concluded that due to the absence of relevant keywords and language, the case is not a class action. This step is correct given the lack of evidence indicating that the case is a class action.

Analysis
The LLM response correctly follows the steps outlined in the thinking instructions. It accurately assesses that there is no indication the discussed case, Laidlaw v. Borrecco et al., is a class action either by explicit mention or justified inference. There is no contradiction, misinterpretation, or divergence from the task instructions. The LLM decision to rate the case as ""No"" for being a class action is aligned with the guidelines set out in the task.

Emerson will, upon consultation with AspenTech and in consideration of AspenTech's views in good faith, be entitled to direct the defense of the Transactions before any governmental authority and to take the lead in the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with, and the conducting of negotiations with, governmental authorities regarding (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period relating to the Merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any other antitrust laws or (iii) obtaining any consent from a governmental authority.

Litigation Relating to the Transactions

On January 13, January 21, February 2, February 17, March 8, and March 21, 2022, purported stockholders of AspenTech filed complaints in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the District of Delaware alleging that disclosures contained within this registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part are incomplete. The complaints are brought individually and are captioned: Stein v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case 22-cv-00329 (S.D.N.Y.), Gaylord v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case 22-cv-00373 (E.D.N.Y.), Ciccotelli v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case 22-cv-00581 (S.D.N.Y.), Khan v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case 22-cv-00897 (S.D.N.Y.), Garfield v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 22-1059 (Mass.), Whitfield v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case No. 22-cv-00872 (E.D.P.A.) and Rogers v. Aspen Technology, Inc. et al., Case 22-cv-00357 (D. Del.). The plaintiffs seek various remedies, including among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the Transactions, unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed. On February 8, 2022, AspenTech received a demand letter on behalf of one of the purported stockholders above, seeking access to certain books and records of AspenTech, which was subsequently withdrawn. On March 10, 2022, AspenTech received a demand letter on behalf of a purported stockholder, seeking access to certain books and records of AspenTech. On March 22, April 5 and April 6, 2022, AspenTech received demand letters on behalf of other purported stockholders, demanding that AspenTech take actions to address certain alleged disclosure deficiencies contained within this registration statement of which this combined proxy statement/prospectus forms a part.

AspenTech Non-Solicitation; AspenTech's Ability to Change Recommendation

The Transaction Agreement provides that, from the date of the Transaction Agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the Merger and the termination of the Transaction Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as described below, neither AspenTech nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees will, and AspenTech will instruct and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' respective investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions (other than to request clarification of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal for purposes of assessing whether such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below)) or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to AspenTech or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of AspenTech or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any third party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or an offer, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Emerson, the AspenTech Board's recommendation to the AspenTech stockholders to adopt the Transaction Agreement (any failure to publicly (A) if a tender or exchange offer for AspenTech common stock that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, recommend against such Acquisition Proposal within ten business days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the AspenTech Board's recommendation to the AspenTech stockholders to adopt the Transaction Agreement within ten business days after written request by Emerson to do so will be treated as a withdrawal of the AspenTech Board's recommendation to the AspenTech stockholders to adopt the Transaction Agreement; provided that Emerson will be entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation only once for each Acquisition Proposal and once for each material amendment to such Acquisition Proposal) or recommend an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an ""Adverse Recommendation Change""), (iv) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of AspenTech or any of its subsidiaries (provided that if the AspenTech Board determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then (A) AspenTech may fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any such standstill or similar agreement to the extent necessary to permit the person bound by such provision or agreement to make an Acquisition Proposal to the AspenTech Board and (B) concurrently with such waiver, release or failure to enforce by AspenTech, any standstill or similar provisions in the confidentiality agreement between AspenTech and Emerson will immediately and automatically cease to be of any force or effect), (v) approve any transaction under, or any person becoming an ""interested stockholder"" under, Section 203 of the DGCL or (vi) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

```",NOBLAW66573085,TRUE,no hallucination,"To determine if there was a hallucination in the LLM's response, let's analyze the steps it followed and compare them to the provided excerpts.

1. **Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**: 
   - The LLM reviewed the excerpts and found no explicit mention of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or related terms concerning the case Garfield v. Aspen Technology, Inc., Civil Action No. 22-1059.
   - Verification of this step with the provided excerpts shows no explicit mentions of these keywords, so the LLM's finding aligns with the content.

2. **Search for Other Keywords**:
   - The LLM searched for language that explicitly states the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals.""
   - The task was to identify if the plaintiffs are representing a larger group, typically found in class actions.
   - The LLM found no such language in the content related to the target case. A review of the excerpts confirms this; none of the language indicated a class representation for the Garfield case.

3. **Assess Negative**:
   - Based on the lack of indicative keywords or language, the LLM correctly concluded that the Garfield case is not a class action.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Due to the nature of our business, we are involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcome of all of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Six purported holders of Umpqua common stock filed complaints relating to the proposed Mergers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York: Neely v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-10171 (filed November 30, 2021) (""Neely""); Wang v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-10143 (filed November 30, 2021) (""Wang""); Mackie v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-10237 (filed December 1, 2021) (""Mackie""); Mason v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-10912 (filed December 20, 2021) (""Mason""); Wilson v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:22-cv-00090 (filed January 5, 2022) (""Wilson""); and Jones v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:22-cv-00122 (filed January 6, 2022) (""Jones""). Two additional purported holders of Umpqua common stock filed complaints relating to the proposed Mergers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Green v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 1:21-cv-06729 (filed December 4, 2021) (""Green"")), and in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Ciccotelli v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation et al., No. 2:21-cv-05610 (filed December 23, 2021 (""Ciccotelli"")). The Neely, Wang, Mackie, Mason, Green, Ciccotelli, Wilson and Jones complaints named Umpqua and its directors as defendants. In addition, a purported holder of Columbia common stock filed a complaint relating to the proposed Mergers in the Superior Court for the State of Washington, King County (Delman v. Clint E. Stein et al., No. 21-2-16297-1 SEA (filed December 13, 2021) (""Delman"")). The Delman complaint named Columbia and its directors as defendants, and also named Umpqua as a defendant. A purported holder of Umpqua common stock filed a complaint related to the proposed Mergers in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah (Martin Siegel v. Umpqua Holdings Corporation, No. 22CV03612 (filed January 28, 2022) (""Siegel"")). The Siegel complaint names Umpqua as the defendant and seeks to compel inspection of records.

The federal complaints generally alleged that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed with the SEC on December 3, 2021, contains material omissions in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and the state complaint alleged state law claims of breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting such breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. The complaints sought various legal and equitable relief, generally including, among other things, orders (i) enjoining the defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the proposed Mergers until the allegedly omitted information was disclosed, (ii) rescinding the Mergers if consummated, or awarding rescissory damages, (iii) directing the Umpqua board of directors to file a corrected Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (iv) awarding plaintiffs' costs, including attorneys' fees. We believe that the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit and specifically deny that any supplemental disclosure was or is required under applicable law. However, in order to moot certain of the plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the complaints, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay, and to provide additional information to shareholders of Umpqua, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Umpqua voluntarily provided additional disclosures. Umpqua and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to Umpqua's shareholders, as applicable.

The Mason complaint was voluntarily dismissed on January 21, 2022; the Ciccotelli, Jones, Mackie, Wang, and Wilson complaints were voluntarily dismissed on January 28, 2022; the Neely complaint was voluntarily dismissed on January 31, 2022; and the Green complaint was dismissed on February 1, 2022. The Delman complaint was dismissed with prejudice on January 28, 2022.

Supplemental Disclosures Relating to Certain Lawsuits

Beginning in January 2022, CMC and its directors were named as defendants in certain lawsuits alleging, among other things, that the Definitive Proxy Statement omitted certain material information in connection with the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and/or Delaware state law. Eight such lawsuits (the ""Matters"") have been filed on behalf of purported stockholders of CMC in federal court and Illinois state court: Stein v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00552 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2022); Ciccotelli v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00689 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2022) (which additionally named Entegris and Merger Sub as defendants); Garfield v. Noglows, et al., Case No. 2022CH000026 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Feb. 1, 2022); Finger v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00188-UNA (D. Del. Feb. 10, 2022); Whitfield v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:22-cv-00560 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 11, 2022); Oday v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00823 (E.D.N.Y Feb. 14, 2022); Raul v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-01399 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2022); and Taylor v. CMC Materials, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00219-UNA (D. Del. Feb. 18, 2022). The Matters seek, among other relief, an injunction preventing the closing of the Merger, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, damages and an award of plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees.

CMC believes the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Matters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, CMC has agreed to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement as described in this supplement. CMC and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to CMC's stockholders. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, CMC specifically denies all allegations in the Matters that any additional disclosure was or is required.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and did not find any explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" I found the phrase ""on behalf of purported stockholders of CMC"" in the document, but this does not necessarily mean the case is a class action. The phrase ""purported stockholders"" does not provide explicit evidence that the plaintiff is representing a class of similarly situated individuals.

3. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or explicit language suggesting that the case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

Here is the JSON object with my conclusion:

    ""note"": ""The document does not contain any keywords or explicit language suggesting that the case is a class action.""
}
```",NOBLAW66083620,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Analyzing Possible Contradictions and Misinterpretations
1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The LLM correctly identified that there is no explicit mention of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms in the provided filing excerpts. This is consistent with the excerpts, as there are no such keywords present.

2. **Search for other keywords**: The LLM also searched for phrases indicating that the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" It found the phrase ""on behalf of purported stockholders of CMC."" According to the task instructions, ""purported stockholders"" does not qualify as explicit evidence of a class action.

3. **Assess negative**: Given the absence of both explicit ""class action"" terminology and other language indicating class representation, it is reasonable for the LLM to conclude that the case is not a class action. The assessment aligns with the task instructions, which specify that in the absence of such evidence, the answer should be ""No.""

There are no contradictions or misinterpretations in the LLM's response. The LLM correctly followed the provided instructions and applicable criteria for assessing whether the case is a class action. Thus, no hallucination or false information is present in the response.

Step 2: Checking for Divergence from Task Instructions
The LLM followed the task instructions precisely by searching for explicit mentions of ""class action"" and evaluating for language suggesting class representation. The response is aligned with the task's requirements and does not diverge from them.

Final Determination:
The LLM did not hallucinate in its response. The analysis is consistent with the provided instructions and the information in the excerpts.

As previously disclosed, on December 20, 2021, Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (""Bluerock Residential"" or the ""Company""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Badger Parent LLC (""Parent"") and Badger Merger Sub LLC (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the ""Merger""), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Company's board of directors. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P., an affiliate of Blackstone Inc. In addition, as previously disclosed, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company will complete the separation of its single-family residential real estate business (the ""Single-Family Business"") from the Company's multi-family residential real estate business (the ""Separation""). Following the Separation, the Single-Family Business will be indirectly held by Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""Bluerock Homes""), and, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company will distribute the common stock of Bluerock Homes to the Company's common stockholders as of the record date for such distribution in a taxable distribution (the ""Distribution"").

In connection with the proposed Merger, Bluerock Residential filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement""), which Bluerock Residential first mailed to its stockholders on or about March 11, 2022.

Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, four lawsuits challenging the Merger have been filed (each, a ""Lawsuit"" and, collectively, the ""Lawsuits""). The Lawsuits are captioned (i) Samuel Marchese v. Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01234, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2022; (ii) Matthew Whitfield v. Ramin Kamfar, et al., No. 24C22001079, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on February 25, 2022; (iii) Robert Garfield v. Robert Ramin Kamfar, et al., No. 602620/2022, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on March 1, 2022; and (iv) Stephen Bushansky v. Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02482, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 28, 2022. In addition, Bluerock Residential received demand letters from counsel representing individual stockholders of the Company (the ""Demand Letters"" and, together with the Lawsuits, the ""Matters""). The Matters each allege, among other things, that the defendants disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement relating to the proposed Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.

The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Matters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the lawsuits, and to provide additional information to stockholders, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has agreed to supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Matters that any additional disclosure was or is required. The inclusion in this Current Report on Form 8-K of certain information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any other recipient of this information, considered, or now considers, it to be material, and such information should not be relied upon as such.

On February 21, 2022, the Company received a demand letter and draft complaint, captioned Stone v. Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., et al., from a purported stockholder of the Company. The demand letter requests that the Company and the board of directors issue disclosures correcting purported deficiencies in the proxy statement alleged in the draft complaint. The draft complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and the board of directors violated certain sections of the Exchange Act by disseminating a misleading or incomplete proxy statement in connection with the merger. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the Company from consummating the merger until the alleged deficiencies in the proxy statement are corrected or, in the event the merger is consummated, to rescind the merger or grant rescissory damages. The Company believes the claims asserted are without merit.

On February 25, 2022, a putative class action complaint, captioned Whitfield v. Kamfar, et al., No. 24C22001079, was filed by a purported stockholder of the Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland. The complaint names the Company and the board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their consideration and approval of the merger as well as by filing an allegedly materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the stockholder vote on the merger and the consummation of the merger, or, in the event the merger is consummated, to rescind the merger or an award of rescissory and/or compensatory damages. The Company believes the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

On March 1, 2022, a complaint, captioned Garfield v. Kamfar, et al., No. 602620/2022, was filed by a purported shareholder of the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau. The complaint names the Company, Parent, and the board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their consideration and approval of the merger as well as by filing an allegedly materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. The complaint further alleges that Parent aided and abetted the directors' breach of fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the stockholder vote on the merger until the alleged deficiencies in the proxy statement are corrected. The Company believes the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and found a mention of ""putative class action complaint"" in the following sentence:

""On February 25, 2022, a putative class action complaint, captioned Whitfield v. Kamfar, et al., No. 24C22001079, was filed by a purported stockholder of the Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland.""

However, this mention does not refer to the target case, which is Garfield v. Kamfar, et al., No. 602620/2022.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Since the keyword ""class action"" does not refer to the target case, I will proceed to the next step.

3. **Search for other keywords**: I reviewed the document and did not find any explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" in the context of the target case.

4. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the target case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```
{
    ""quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""is_class_action"": ""No"",
    ""note"": """"
}
```",NOBLAW92349993,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis:**

Step 1: **Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**

The LLM reviewed the document and identified a mention of ""putative class action complaint"" in the context of the Whitfield case. This is indeed correct, as one of the lawsuits filed, Whitfield v. Kamfar, et al., is described in the filing excerpt as a putative class action. However, this reference is not relevant to the target case, Garfield v. Kamfar, et al., No. 602620/2022. 

Step 2: **Confirm Class Action Mention**

Since the keyword ""class action"" did not refer to the target case, the LLM correctly proceeded to the next step. 

Step 3: **Search for Other Keywords**

The LLM did not find any explicit language stating that the plaintiff in the target case (Garfield v. Kamfar) is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" This analysis is correct based on the provided excerpts. 

Step 4: **Assess Negative**

Having found no mention of class action-like language associated directly with the target case, the LLM concludes that the case is not a class action (""No"" for ""is_class_action""). Again, this conclusion follows logically from the analysis and task instructions, as there is no explicit statement or strong suggestion that the target case, Garfield v. Kamfar, is a class action in the provided excerpts.

Overall, the LLM's response does not contain hallucinations. It correctly analyzed the context, identified the non-relevance of the ""class action"" mentions to the target case, and appropriately determined the classification based on absence of evidence suggesting a class action status for the target case.

JSON:
{
    ""analysis"": ""The LLM correctly identified that the 'putative class action' mention referred to a different case, not the target case, and it appropriately followed the given steps to logically conclude the target case is not a class action.

As previously disclosed, on June 24, 2022, Zendesk, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Zendesk"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement"") with Zoro BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent""), and Zoro Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

In connection with the proposed Merger, Zendesk filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a preliminary proxy statement on July 25, 2022 and a definitive proxy statement on August 8, 2022 (the ""proxy statement""), which Zendesk first mailed to its stockholders on or about August 8, 2022.

Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, nine lawsuits challenging the Merger have been filed (each, a ""Lawsuit"" and collectively, the ""Lawsuits""). Five Lawsuits, captioned Ryan O'Dell v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:22-cv-06418), Sarah Siah v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:22-cv-06611), Matthew Whitfield v. Zendesk, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 1:22-cv-07047), were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; two Lawsuits, captioned Liam Butler v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Case No. 3:22-cv-04414) and Noam Fruchter v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Case No. 3:22-cv-04610), were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; one Lawsuit, captioned Richard Lawrence v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:22-cv-01089), was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; and one Lawsuit, captioned Joel Zalvin v. Zendesk, Inc. et al. (Index No. 156806/2022), was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York. In addition, Zendesk received four demand letters from counsel representing individual stockholders of Zendesk (the ""Demand Letters""). Zendesk also received demand letters pursuant to Section 220 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware seeking inspection of certain Zendesk books and records from counsel representing individual stockholders of Zendesk (the ""220 Demand Letters"" and together with the Demand Letters and the Lawsuits, the ""Matters""). The Matters allege, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.

Zendesk believes that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Matters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Zendesk has agreed to supplement the proxy statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Zendesk and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to Zendesk's stockholders. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein.

   - The provided excerpts do not have such phrases related to the Joel Zalvin case.
   - Conclusion: The LLM correctly upheld this process by confirming there was no such evidence.

4. **Assess Negative**:
   - Given the absence of any term related to ""class action"" or hinting at class representation, the LLM concludes that the case is not a class action.
   - Conclusion: This conclusion is accurate per instructions due to lack of supportive keywords or phrases.

In August 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Compromise and Settlement (""Stipulation"") with the Court setting forth their agreement to settle the litigation. Under the Stipulation, as approved by the Court in January 2022, the defendants' insurers paid $100 million and $23.5 million of this amount was paid to plaintiff's counsel. The Company received cash settlement proceeds of $76.5 million in March 2022 and recognized a gain on legal settlements in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Litigation Relating to the CD&R Merger

On September 2, 2022, a former shareholder of the Company, Matthew Giffuni, filed a Petition for Appraisal of Stock in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The appraisal action is captioned Matthew Q. Giffuni v. Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc., C.A. No. 2022-0780-SG (Del. Ch.). The petitioner seeks, on behalf of himself and one other shareholder seeking appraisal, (i) a determination that petitioners are entitled to appraisal of their shares, (ii) a judgment requiring the Company to pay the fair value of the petitioners' shares as determined by the court, and (iii) interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The document mentions that the petitioner seeks relief ""on behalf of himself and one other shareholder seeking appraisal."" However, this language does not provide explicit and direct evidence that the plaintiff is representing a class of similarly situated individuals.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed merger with affiliates of BREIT, plaintiffs filed eight separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. The first suit, styled as Stein v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02589-LAK, which we refer to as the ""Stein Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Shiva Stein in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 30, 2022. The second suit, styled as Wang v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-02641-LAK, which we refer to as the ""Wang Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Elaine Wang in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 31, 2022.

The fourth suit, styled as Hopkins v. Murphy, et al., No. 24-C-22-001775, which we refer to as the ""Hopkins Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Matthew Hopkins in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 8, 2022. The fifth suit, styled as Ferguson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-03033, which we refer to as the ""Ferguson Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Robert Ferguson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 12, 2022. The sixth suit, styled as Whitfield v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01542-RBS, which we refer to as the ""Whitfield Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Matthew Whitfield in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on April 20, 2022. The seventh suit, styled as Weinrib v. Bartkowski, et al., No. 24-C-22-002041, which we refer to as the ""Weinrib Lawsuit,"" was filed by plaintiff Lori Weinrib, in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 25, 2022. The eighth suit, styled as Milbourne v.

The Stein Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and the Company's directors. The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of the individual plaintiff, (1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing regulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading; and (2) a ""control person"" claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violation. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non-GAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow information, and input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees.

The Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company's directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit.

```",NOBLAW59953220,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the response from the LLM step by step:

Step 1: Search for keyword ""class action""

The LLM correctly noted that there are no explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms in the provided excerpts. The excerpts detail the filing information and do not contain these specific keywords.

Step 2: Search for other keywords

The LLM then looked for explicit language that might suggest a class action, specifically language indicating representation of similarly situated individuals. The excerpts do not contain such language. The response we have states ""on behalf of an individual plaintiff,"" implying that the claim is brought individually rather than as part of a larger group or class.

Step 3: Assess negative

Given the absence of both direct ""class action"" keywords and any language suggesting the action is on behalf of similarly situated individuals, the LLM correctly concluded that the case in question is not a class action.

Evaluation of Hallucination

- Contradictions: The LLM's response is in line with the information provided in the excerpts. It did not make any statements counter to the content of the supporting excerpts.
  
- Misinterpretations: The LLM accurately understood that the phrase ""on behalf of an individual plaintiff"" excludes the interpretation of a class action.

- Divergence from Task Instructions: The LLM followed the task instructions, looking for both explicit and implicit indicators of a class action. It classified the case correctly based on the absence of such indicators.

Based on these points, the LLM did not make a hallucination in this instance.

The Parent Parties are affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Mergers (as defined below) (the ""Closing""), Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership (the ""Partnership Merger""), with the Partnership surviving (the ""Surviving Partnership""), immediately following the Partnership Merger, Operations will merge with and into Merger Sub III (the ""Operations Merger""), with Merger Sub III surviving, and immediately following the Operations Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub I (the ""Company Merger"" and, together with the Partnership Merger and the Operations Merger, the ""Mergers"") with Merger Sub I surviving. A definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") by the Company on April 14, 2022, in connection with, among other things, the Merger Agreement.

Certain Merger-Related Litigation Matters

Following the filing of the Proxy Statement, six additional lawsuits were filed relating to the Mergers and the Proxy Statement: Whitfield v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01542-RBS, which we refer to as the ""Whitfield Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; Weinrib v. Bartkowski, et al., No. 24-C-22-002041, which we refer to as the ""Weinrib Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City; Milbourne v. Bartkowski, et al., 24-C-22-002038 which we refer to as the ""Milbourne Lawsuit,"" was also filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City; Grady v. Preferred Apartment Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-02588-AMD-SJB, which we refer to as the ""Grady Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York; Taylor v.

Preferred Apartment Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04053, which we refer to as the ""Watson Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The Whitfield Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company and the members of our board of directors and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the directors. The Whitfield Lawsuit alleges that the Proxy Statement omits material information on certain topics, including the line items used to calculate the financial projections, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis and the Company's nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties. The Whitfield Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees.

The Weinrib Lawsuit and the Milbourne Lawsuits are nearly identical to each other in all respects. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits each allege that the Proxy Statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis, information relating to the work performed by KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company's officers and directors, discussions the Company may have had with Arkhouse Securities LLC after Arkhouse sent the Company a nomination notice for five board seats, and information regarding whether the board considered the possibility that Arkhouse was working in concert with Blackstone. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits also allege that the Company's officers stand to benefit from the proposed merger, that the directors failed to evaluate appropriately the Company's worth, that the directors failed to enhance the Company's value and protect shareholder interests, and that the Company did not engage in a meaningful auction. Relying on those allegations, the Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits each assert a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors in their role as directors, a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all the Company and the directors, and a claim against Mr. Murphy for allegedly breaching his fiduciary duties as an officer of the Company. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits seek declaratory relief, an injunction barring the shareholder vote and the consummation of the proposed merger, rescission of the merger if it is consummated, and an award of damages and attorney's fees.

Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit.

Litigation Related to the Mergers

On February 16, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with certain affiliates of Blackstone Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as ""Blackstone."" Under the terms of the merger agreement, Blackstone will acquire us and our subsidiaries, including Preferred Apartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P. (the ""Partnership"") and PAC Operations, LLC (""Operations""), through the merger of us with and into Pike Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as ""Merger Sub I"", the merger of Pike Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as ""Merger Sub II"", with and into the Partnership and the merger of Operations with and into Pike Merger Sub III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as ""Merger Sub III."" Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership. Immediately following the partnership merger effective time, Operations will merge with and into Merger Sub III, with Merger Sub III continuing as the Surviving Operations Entity. Immediately following the operations merger effective time, we will merge with and into Merger Sub I, with Merger Sub I continuing as the Surviving Company.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement, plaintiffs filed eight separate lawsuits related to the proxy statement. The first suit, styled as Stein v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02589-LAK, which we refer to as the ""Stein Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The second suit, styled as Wang v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-02641-LAK, which we refer to as the ""Wang Lawsuit,"" was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The third suit, styled as Anderson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01979-LDH-RML, which we refer to as the ""Anderson Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The fourth suit, styled as Hopkins v. Murphy, et al., No. 24-C-22-001775, which we refer to as the ""Hopkins Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The fifth suit, styled as Ferguson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-03033, which we refer to as the ""Ferguson Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The sixth suit, styled as Whitfield v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01542-RBS, which we refer to as the ""Whitfield Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The seventh suit, styled as Weinrib v. Bartkowski, et al., No. 24-C-22-002041, which we refer to as the ""Weinrib Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The eighth suit, styled as Milbourne v. Bartkowski, et al., No. 24-C-22-002038, which we refer to as the ""Milbourne Lawsuit,"" was also filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City.

The Stein Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and the Company's directors. The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of an individual plaintiff, (1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing regulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading; and (2) a ""control person"" claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violation. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non-GAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow information, and input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees.

The Wang Lawsuit also names as defendants the Company and the Company's directors. Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I have reviewed the document and did not find any explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I have searched for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" However, I did not find any such language in the excerpts related to the Milbourne Lawsuit (24-C-22-002038).

3. **Assess negative**: Since the document does not contain any keywords or language suggesting that the case is a class action, I conclude that the case is not a class action.

```",NOBLAW47352887,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's carefully analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response by scrutinizing the provided excerpts and instructions.

### Analysis

**Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**
- The LLM correctly notes that there are no explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms in the excerpts concerning the Milbourne Lawsuit.

**Step 2: Search for Other Keywords**
- The LLM checked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals"" but found none related to the Milbourne Lawsuit.

**Step 3: Assess Negative**
- The LLM correctly follows up with an assessment that, due to the absence of the keywords or similar language pertaining to the Milbourne Lawsuit, the document does not indicate it is a class action.

**Conclusion**
- The LLM has carefully followed the instructions in assessing the target case, the Milbourne Lawsuit. Given that the excerpts did not provide any mention or evidence that suggests the Milbourne Lawsuit is a class action, the LLM's conclusion of ""No"" for ""is_class_action"" is appropriate and accurate.
- No evidence of contradiction, misinterpretation, or divergence from the task instructions was found in the LLM's response.

### Final Assessment

The LLM did not make a hallucination. The response is consistent, accurate, and follows the task instructions properly.

As previously disclosed, on February 16, 2022, Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the ""Company""), Preferred Apartment Communities Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Partnership""), PAC Operations, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Operations""), Pike Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), Pike Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Merger Sub I""), Pike Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Merger Sub II""), and Pike Merger Sub III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Merger Sub III"" and, together with Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, the ""Parent Parties"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""). The Parent Parties are affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Mergers (as defined below) (the ""Closing""), Merger Sub II will merge with and into the Partnership (the ""Partnership Merger""), with the Partnership surviving (the ""Surviving Partnership""), immediately following the Partnership Merger, Operations will merge with and into Merger Sub III (the ""Operations Merger""), with Merger Sub III surviving, and immediately following the Operations Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub I (the ""Company Merger"" and, together with the Partnership Merger and the Operations Merger, the ""Mergers"") with Merger Sub I surviving. A definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") by the Company on April 14, 2022, in connection with, among other things, the Merger Agreement.

Certain Merger-Related Litigation Matters

Following the filing of the Proxy Statement, six additional lawsuits were filed relating to the Mergers and the Proxy Statement: Whitfield v. Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01542-RBS, which we refer to as the ""Whitfield Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; Weinrib v. Bartkowski, et al., No. 24-C-22-002041, which we refer to as the ""Weinrib Lawsuit,"" was filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City; Milbourne v. Bartkowski, et al., 24-C-22-002038 which we refer to as the ""Milbourne Lawsuit,"" was also filed in the Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City; Grady v. Preferred Apartment Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-02588-AMD-SJB, which we refer to as the ""Grady Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York; Taylor v. Preferred Apartment Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04044, which we refer to as the ""Taylor Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and Watson v. Preferred Apartment Communities, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04053, which we refer to as the ""Watson Lawsuit,"" was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

The Whitfield Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company and the members of our board of directors and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the directors. The Whitfield Lawsuit alleges that the Proxy Statement omits material information on certain topics, including the line items used to calculate the financial projections, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis and the Company's nondisclosure agreements with potential counterparties. The Whitfield Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees.

The Weinrib Lawsuit and the Milbourne Lawsuits are nearly identical to each other in all respects. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits each allege that the Proxy Statement omits material information on certain topics, including certain financial projections, line items used to calculate financial projections, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis, information relating to the work performed by KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., details regarding any discussions about the future employment of the Company's officers and directors, discussions the Company may have had with Arkhouse Securities LLC after Arkhouse sent the Company a nomination notice for five board seats, and information regarding whether the board considered the possibility that Arkhouse was working in concert with Blackstone. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits also allege that the Company's officers stand to benefit from the proposed merger, that the directors failed to evaluate appropriately the Company's worth, that the directors failed to enhance the Company's value and protect shareholder interests, and that the Company did not engage in a meaningful auction. Relying on those allegations, the Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits each assert a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors in their role as directors, a claim for declaratory and equitable relief against all the Company and the directors, and a claim against Mr. Murphy for allegedly breaching his fiduciary duties as an officer of the Company. The Weinrib and Milbourne Lawsuits seek declaratory relief, an injunction barring the shareholder vote and the consummation of the proposed merger, rescission of the merger if it is consummated, and an award of damages and attorney's fees.

The Stein Lawsuit names as defendants the Company and the Company's directors. The Stein Lawsuit asserts, on behalf of the individual plaintiff, (1) a cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its implementing regulations, alleging that purported omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading; and (2) a ""control person"" claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the alleged Section 14(a) violation. The Stein Lawsuit alleges that the proxy statement omits material information on certain topics, including line items used to calculate non-GAAP financial metrics, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to GAAP metrics, levered free cash flow information, and input data and assumptions used in Goldman Sachs' analysis. Relying on those allegations, the Stein Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Stein Lawsuit seeks to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the proposed merger, rescission of the merger and an award of damages if the merger is consummated, and an award of plaintiff's costs and attorney's fees.

Like the Stein Lawsuit, the Wang Lawsuit asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of our board of directors. The Wang Lawsuit contains substantially the same allegations as the Stein Lawsuit and seeks substantially the same relief as the Stein Lawsuit.

1. **Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**

The LLM correctly followed the task instructions by searching the document for explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms. As per the excerpts provided, there are no mentions of ""class action"" in relation to the Target Case, Weinrib v. Bartkowski, et al. The LLM correctly identified the absence of these terms.

2. **Search for Other Keywords**

The next step was to search for other phrases indicating class representation, such as language stating the plaintiff is acting ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" The LLM accurately reported that such language is absent in the provided context for the Target Case. The lawsuit by Lori Weinrib does not mention representation of a broader group or class.

3. **Assess Negative**

Given the absence of explicit terms or phrases suggesting a class action from Steps 1 and 2, the LLM concludes that the Target Case is not a class action. This conclusion is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts.

Summary:

The LLM methodically followed the task instructions and analyzed the excerpts without introducing information not present in the document. It reached the correct conclusion based on the lack of evidence for the Target Case being a class action.

Seven complaints related to the merger have been filed through April 7, 2022. On March 15, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned O'Dell v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02135 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""O'Dell Complaint""). On March 17, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Truhlicka v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02199 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Truhlicka Complaint""). On March 18, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Waterman v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01516 (E.D.N.Y) (the ""Waterman Complaint""), and another purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned Whitfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01052 (E.D. Pa.) (the ""Whitfield Complaint""). On March 22, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Greenfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01571 (E.D.N.Y) (the ""Greenfield Complaint""). On March 29, 2022 a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Kirsch v. Tenneco, et al., No. 1:22-cv-00399 (D. Del.) (the ""Kirsch Complaint,"" and together with the O'Dell Complaint, Truhlicka Complaint, Waterman Complaint, Whitfield Complaint, and Greenfield Complaint, the ""Federal Complaints"").

The Federal Complaints name Tenneco and members of its board of directors as defendants and allege that defendants made materially incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of Tenneco by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 14 and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, challenging the adequacy of disclosures regarding the Company's projections, Lazard's financial analyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022 (the ""Preliminary Proxy""). The Federal Complaints seek, among other relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (ii) rescission in the event the merger is consummated, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

On March 30, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial District of the State of Illinois, Lake County, captioned Drulias v. Armes, et al., No. 22CH00000102 (lll. Cir. Ct. Lake Co.) (the ""Drulias Complaint""). The Drulias Complaint names Tenneco, members of its board of directors, and Apollo Global Management, Inc. as defendants. The plaintiff asserts claims for violation of the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois statutory and common law, alleges that the acquisition price and process was unfair to shareholders, and challenges the adequacy of disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy regarding the Company's projections, Lazard's financial analyses and fairness opinion, management conflicts of interest, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction. The Drulias Complaint seeks, among other relief, (i) declaratory relief stating that defendants violated the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois statutory and common law, (ii) injunctive relief preventing defendants from holding a shareholder vote and proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

Stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the merger, which may name the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, or members of the Board of Directors for the Company or Parent and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the complaint, including the amount of costs associated with defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of, such claims. Tenneco believes that the Complaints are without merit.

Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02199 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Truhlicka Complaint""). On March 18, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Waterman v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01516 (E.D.N.Y) (the ""Waterman Complaint""), and another purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned Whitfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01052 (E.D. Pa.) (the ""Whitfield Complaint""). On March 22, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Greenfield v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01571 (E.D.N.Y) (the ""Greenfield Complaint""). On March 29, 2022 a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Kirsch v. Tenneco Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00399 (D. Del.) (the ""Kirsch Complaint,"" and together with the O'Dell Complaint, Truhlicka Complaint, Waterman Complaint, Whitfield Complaint, and Greenfield Complaint, the ""Federal Complaints"").

The Federal Complaints name Tenneco and members of its board of directors as defendants and allege that defendants made materially incomplete and misleading statements about the proposed acquisition of Tenneco by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, challenging the adequacy of disclosures regarding the Company's projections, Lazard's financial analyses, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022 (the ""Preliminary Proxy""). The Federal Complaints seek, among other relief, (i) injunctive relief preventing the parties from proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (ii) rescission in the event the merger is consummated, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

On March 30, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tenneco filed an action in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial District of the State of Illinois, Lake County, captioned Drulias v. Armes, et al., No. 22CH00000102 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Lake Co.) (the ""Drulias Complaint""). The Drulias Complaint names Tenneco, members of its board of directors, and Apollo Global Management, Inc. as defendants. The plaintiff asserts claims for violation of the Illinois Securities Act of 1953, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and concealment under Illinois statutory and common law, alleges that the acquisition price and process was unfair to shareholders, and challenges the adequacy of disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy regarding the Company's projections, Lazard's financial analyses and fairness opinion, management conflicts of interest, and the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction. The Drulias Complaint seeks, among other relief, (i) declaratory relief stating that defendants violated the Illinois Securities Act of 1953 and Illinois statutory and common law, (ii) injunctive relief preventing defendants from holding a shareholder vote and proceeding with the merger until the alleged disclosure deficiencies have been remedied, (iii) damages, and (iv) an award of costs, including attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses.

Stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the merger, which may name the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, or members of the Board of Directors for the Company or Parent and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the complaint, including the amount of costs associated with defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of, such claims. Tenneco believes that the Complaints are without merit.

Further, plaintiffs in the Hein, Tenvold, Klein, Wheby, Jr., Davis, Bushansky, and Pappey actions sought to recover on behalf of a putative class consisting of all similarly situated Finisar stockholders.

Plaintiff in the Hein action alleged that the Finisar Board breached its fiduciary duties to Finisar stockholders by, among other things, purportedly engaging in an insufficient sales process, obtaining inadequate merger consideration, and filing a materially misleading preliminary proxy statement. The Hein plaintiff further asserted that II-VI and the Merger Subsidiary knowingly aided and abetted the Finisar Board in breaching their fiduciary duties to Finisar stockholders by entering into the Merger. The Hein plaintiff sought a preliminary and permanent injunction of the proposed transaction unless the proxy statement was amended, rescission and unspecified damages if the Merger was consummated, and attorneys' fees and expert fees and costs.

The Finisar Stockholder Actions name as defendants Finisar and each member of the Finisar Board (together, the ""Finisar Defendants""). In addition, the Hein, Tenvold, and Klein complaints name II-VI and Merger Sub as defendants. The Hein, Tenvold, Klein, Wheby, Davis, Bushansky, and Pappey lawsuits are putative class actions in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of themselves and a putative class defined as all similarly-situated Finisar stockholders.

The Hein complaint alleges that the Finisar Board breached its fiduciary duties to Finisar stockholders by purportedly engaging in an insufficient sales process, obtaining inadequate merger consideration, and filing a materially misleading preliminary proxy statement that does not include, among other things, material information regarding the sales process, financial projections for both Finisar and II-VI, and financial analyses conducted by their financial advisors. The Hein complaint further asserts that Finisar, II-VI, and Merger Sub knowingly aided and abetted the Finisar Board in breaching their fiduciary duties to Finisar stockholders by entering into the proposed transaction. The Hein complaint seeks to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the proposed transaction unless the information requested by the plaintiff is disclosed. The Hein complaint also seeks rescission and unspecified damages if the Merger is consummated, and attorneys' fees and expert fees and costs.

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A.

No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions are pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM (D. Colo.); and one action is pending in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company believes that each of these complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-VCMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-VCMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-VCMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, the following complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Zayo and its directors: on June 7, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA; on June 12, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a complaint, captioned Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA; on June 17, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA; and on June 18, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned, Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-UNA. The complaints assert claims for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against Zayo and its directors, and claims for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Zayo directors. The complaint captioned Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA also asserts a claim for violations of 17 C.F.R. §244.100 against Zayo and its directors. The complaints allege, among other things, that Zayo and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

On June 17, 2019, a purported Zayo stockholder filed a complaint, captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-KLM, and on June 21, 2019, another purported Zayo stockholder filed a complaint, captioned Karels v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01809-MEH, against Zayo and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaints assert claims for violations of Section 14(a) and SEC Rule 14a-9 against Zayo and its directors, and claims for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Zayo directors. The complaints allege, among other things, that Zayo and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

On June 18, 2019, another purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601, against Zayo and its directors in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zayo and its directors. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger due to certain deal protection provisions in the merger agreement and potential conflicts of interest, and disseminated a materially misleading proxy statement. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the merger was entered into in breach of fiduciary duty, rescission and invalidation of the merger agreement or other agreements entered into in connection with or in furtherance of the merger, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The defendants believe each of these federal cases are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.

We have also received five demands from Zayo stockholders pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records for, among other things, the purported purpose of investigating whether the board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. We rejected all five of these demands, which prompted three of the stockholders to file complaints against us to enforce their Section 220 rights. These cases, all of which seek the books and records demanded in the respective letters are captioned as follows: Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-VCMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-VCMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-VCMR (July 31, 2019). We intend to vigorously defend against these actions.

Did the LLM correctly identify the mention of ""class action""?

The LLM states that the Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. case is mentioned as a ""putative class action complaint."" Upon examining the filing excerpts provided, the complaint indeed includes this description.

Did the LLM misquote or misinterpret the excerpts?

No, the LLM accurately identifies and quotes the relevant passage: ""On June 18, 2019, another purported Zayo stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601, against Zayo and its directors in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado.""

On February 22, 2019, another purported stockholder of the Company filed a derivative and class action lawsuit against the Company, its board of directors and Omega in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, entitled Scarantino v.

In addition, notifications and/or applications requesting approval may be submitted to various other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, including certain state insurance departments. Neither First Financial nor HopFed is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion of the Merger other than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional governmental approvals or actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or actions will be obtained.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On May 14, 2019, a purported holder of HopFed common stock filed a putative stockholder class action complaint against HopFed, the members of the HopFed board of directors, and First Financial in the Christian County Circuit Court, Commonwealth of Kentucky. The complaint is captioned as follows: Parshall v. HopFed Bancorp, Inc., et al., No. 19-CI00470 (Christian Cnty. Cir. Ct. filed May 14, 2019). The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the HopFed board of directors for, among other things, allegedly undervaluing HopFed and omitting material information from the registration statement on Form S-4 filed on April 11, 2019 with the SEC. The complaint also asserts a claim for aiding and abetting the HopFed board of directors' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties against HopFed and First Financial. Among other remedies, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin the Merger and rescind the Merger or recover damages in the event the Merger is completed. The court has not acted on this complaint, and no relief has been granted as of this time. The defendants believe the claims and allegations are without merit.

On June 11, 2019, a purported holder of HopFed common stock filed a putative stockholder class action complaint against HopFed and the members of the HopFed board of directors in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The complaint is captioned as follows: Bushansky v. HopFed Bancorp, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:19-cv-00084-TBR (W.D. Ky. filed June 11, 2019). The complaint asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder against HopFed and the members of the HopFed board of directors and under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the members of the HopFed board of directors for allegedly disseminating a false and misleading registration statement on Form S-4, which was filed with the SEC on April 11, 2019, as amended on June 6, 2019. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties against the members of the HopFed board of directors for, among other things, allegedly agreeing to provisions in the Merger Agreement that are alleged to prevent third party offers to acquire HopFed, engaging in self-dealing, and causing materially misleading and incomplete information to be disseminated. Among other remedies, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin the Merger and any stockholder vote on the Merger and rescind the Merger or recover damages in the event the Merger is completed. The court has not acted on this complaint, and no relief has been granted as of this time. The defendants believe the claims and allegations are without merit.

The outcome of the pending and any additional future litigation is uncertain. If any case is not resolved, the lawsuit(s) could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to First Financial and HopFed, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. Other potential plaintiffs may file additional lawsuits against First Financial, HopFed, and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the Merger. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no order, injunction, or decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition that prevents the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting First Financial or HopFed defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe and could result in significant costs to First Financial and/or HopFed. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Item 8.01 Other Events

On May 14, 2019, a purported stockholder of HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (""HopFed"") common stock filed a putative stockholder class action against HopFed, the members of the HopFed board of directors, and First Financial Corporation (""First Financial""), in the Christian County Circuit Court, Commonwealth of Kentucky (the ""Action""). The complaint is captioned as follows: Parshall v. HopFed Bancorp, Inc., et al., No. 19-CI00470 (Christian Cnty. Cir. Ct. filed May 14, 2019) (the ""Complaint""). The Complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the HopFed board of directors for, among other things, allegedly undervaluing HopFed and omitting material information from the proxy statement/prospectus (as amended or supplemented, the ""Proxy Statement/Prospectus"") forming a part of the registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented, the ""Registration Statement"") filed on April 11, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the proposed merger of HopFed with and into First Financial (the ""Merger""). The Complaint also asserts a claim for aiding and abetting the HopFed board of directors' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties against HopFed and First Financial. Among other remedies, the Action seeks to enjoin the Merger or rescind the Merger or recover damages in the event the Merger is completed. The court has not acted on this Complaint, and no relief has been granted in the Action as of this time.

The defendants believe that the Complaint is without merit and no further disclosure is or was required under applicable law to supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. However, to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and to avoid any possible delay to the closing of the Merger that might arise from further litigation, counsel for all parties to the Action reached an agreement in principle to settle the Action, pursuant to which First Financial would file agreed-upon supplemental disclosures with the SEC (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). First Financial made the Supplemental Disclosures in an amendment to the Registration Statement filed on June 6, 2019 with the SEC. It is expected that any potential settlement will not affect the merger consideration to be paid to HopFed stockholders or the timing of the HopFed special meeting of stockholders to be held on July 23, 2019. As part of the agreement in principle, it is anticipated that the parties will agree to use their reasonable best efforts to complete confirmatory discovery, including depositions of representatives of HopFed and First Financial, and potentially others, as well as the production of documents, and to attempt in good faith to agree upon the final terms of a settlement and such other documentation as may be required to obtain court approval of the settlement and certification of the class. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into any stipulation of settlement or similar documents, or that the court will approve any settlement even if the parties were to enter into such settlement.

Nothing in this document, the Registration Statement, or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or any potential stipulation of settlement or similar documents, shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the Supplemental Disclosures. HopFed, First Financial, and the other named defendants have vigorously denied, and continue to deny, that they have committed any violation of law or aided and abetted in the commission of any violation of law or engaged in any of the wrongful acts alleged in the Complaint, and maintain that, to the extent applicable, they diligently and scrupulously complied with their fiduciary and other legal duties.

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""

- The LLM correctly identifies mentions of the term ""class action"" in the provided filing excerpts. It indicates that the Parshall v. HopFed Bancorp, Inc., et al., No. 19-CI00470 case is referred to as a ""putative stockholder class action"".
- This correctly matches the instructions, which explicitly mention that a statement indicating the case is a class action should be accepted for a ""Yes"" classification.

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention

- The LLM follows the step to confirm that the ""class action"" mention indeed refers to the target case (Parshall v. HopFed Bancorp, Inc.), which is described as a ""putative stockholder class action"".
- This explicit mention directly fulfills the condition for classifying the case as a class action.

Conclusion:

- The LLM accurately identifies and interprets the excerpts according to the task instructions.
- Its reasoning is logical, and the conclusion aligns with the expectations set by the task instructions.

Shares of Fiserv common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to any restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except for shares of Fiserv common stock issued to any First Data stockholder who may be deemed an ""affiliate"" of Fiserv after the completion of the merger. This joint proxy and consent solicitation statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Fiserv common stock received by any person upon the completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this joint and consent solicitation proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any resale of Fiserv common stock.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On February 28, 2019, an action captioned Garfield vs. Fiserv, et al. was filed in the Circuit Court for Waukesha County in the State of Wisconsin, against Fiserv and the Fiserv board on behalf of a putative class of Fiserv shareholders. The complaint alleges generally that members of the Fiserv board breached their fiduciary duties in approving the merger agreement and challenges the adequacy or completeness of the initial version of the joint proxy and consent solicitation statement/prospectus filed on February 14, 2019. The complaint seeks, among other things, declarative relief, money damages and attorney's and expert fees and expenses.

Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any pending or any potential future lawsuits. Fiserv believes that the pending Garfield lawsuit is without merit and Fiserv intends to defend vigorously against it. Fiserv and First Data also intend to defend vigorously against any other future lawsuits challenging the merger.

Fiserv expects to fund the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness of First Data and its subsidiaries on the closing date, the making of cash payments in lieu of fractional shares as part of the merger consideration and the payment of fees and expenses related to the merger, the refinancing and the related transactions using a combination of cash on hand, the permanent financing, which is expected to include the incurrence of up to $5 billion in borrowings under the term loan facility and the issuance of up to $12 billion in debt securities, and borrowings under Fiserv's revolving credit facility. There is a risk that the markets will not allow Fiserv to execute this financing plan, or that a portion of such financing will not be available on favorable terms. As a result, Fiserv may need to pursue other options to refinance the outstanding debt of First Data and its subsidiaries and fund these other amounts, including borrowing up to $12 billion aggregate principal amount under the bridge facility, which may result in less favorable financing terms that could increase costs and/or adversely impact the operations of the combined company. See ""The Merger--Debt Financing"" beginning on page 143.

Litigation relating to the merger could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the merger and/or substantial costs to Fiserv and First Data.

Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any pending or any potential future lawsuits. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect Fiserv's or First Data's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Step 2: Search for other keywords**
- The LLM identified the phrase, ""on behalf of a putative class of Fiserv shareholders,"" in the filing excerpts.

The following language is added after the last full paragraph on page 63 of the Definitive Proxy Statement in the section concerning Litigation Related to the Merger and immediately prior to the section concerning Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock.

""McClintock action""

A putative class action lawsuit captioned McClintock v. The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. et al., Case No. 87274166 (the ""McClintock action""), was filed in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida on April 1, 2019.

The McClintock action names as defendants the Company and each member of our board of directors. The action was brought as a putative class action on behalf of the Company's stockholders, and alleges, among other things, that the director defendants have breached their fiduciary duties in approving the Merger and that the Definitive Proxy Statement is materially misleading and/or incomplete. The McClintock action also makes general allegations about the sale process, certain deal-protection provisions in the Merger Agreement and the vesting of certain stock grants. The McClintock action seeks equitable relief, including among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the merger or to direct the directors of the Company to exercise their fiduciary duties, to recover damages, together with costs of the action, reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees, and any other relief the court may deem just and proper.

The Company cannot predict the outcome of the McClintock action, nor can the Company predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuit. The Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and the Company and the director defendants intend to vigorously defend against it.

The Company is subject to various legal claims and contingencies that arise out of the normal course of business, including claims related to commercial transactions, product liability, health and safety, taxes, environmental matters, employee matters and other matters. Litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and the outcome of individual claims and contingencies is not predictable. It is possible that some legal matters for which reserves have or have not been established could result in an unfavorable outcome for the Company and any such unfavorable outcome could be of a material nature or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

On February 24, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with W/S Packaging Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent""), and Monarch Merger Corporation, an Ohio corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Sub with and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the ""Merger""), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. On April 5, 2019, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") with respect to the Company's special meeting of the shareholders held on May 16, 2019 in connection with the Merger. At the special meeting of the shareholders, the Company received approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger.

On April 29, 2019, the Company was served with a complaint in an action captioned Eric Sabatini, Individually And On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, and Derivatively On Behalf of Multi-Color Corporation v. Nigel A. Vinecombe, Michael J. Henry, Vadis A. Rodato, Alex Baumgartner, Ari J. Benacerraf, Robert R. Buck, Charles B. Connolly, Robert W. Kuhn, Ronald Lienau and Multi-Color Corporation (the ""Sabatini Complaint"") relating to the Merger Agreement and the Proxy Statement. The Sabatini Complaint was filed in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas in the State of Ohio and alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Company shareholders by failing to secure adequate merger consideration and failing to disclose material information in the Proxy Statement. The lawsuit asserts claims on behalf of a putative class of Company shareholders as well as derivatively on behalf of the Company. Among other remedies, the Sabatini Complaint seeks to enjoin the consummation of the Merger (or alternatively, rescission of the Merger in the event the defendants are able to consummate it), as well as damages, costs and attorneys' and experts' fees.

This Amendment No. 2 (this ""Amendment"") amends and supplements the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 of Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""Osiris""), originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 20, 2019 (together with any subsequent amendments and supplements thereto, the ""Schedule 14D-9""). This Amendment relates to the cash tender offer by Papyrus Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation (""Purchaser"") and a direct subsidiary of Smith & Nephew Consolidated, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent""), and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc, an English public limited company (""Smith & Nephew""), as disclosed in the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, filed by Smith & Nephew, Parent and Purchaser with the SEC on March 20, 2019, pursuant to which Purchaser has offered to purchase all of the outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Osiris (the ""Shares"") for a purchase price of $19.00 per Share, in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated March 20, 2019 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""Offer to Purchase""), and the related Letter of Transmittal (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the ""Letter of Transmittal""). Copies of the Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal are filed as Exhibits (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B) to the Schedule 14D-9, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Six purported class action complaints relating to the Transaction were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on March 22, 2019, March 25, 2019, March 27, 2019, April 2, 2019 and April 8, 2019, on behalf of putative classes of Osiris' public shareholders. In addition, two purported class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 25, 2019 and March 29, 2019, also on behalf of putative classes of Osiris' public shareholders. One purported class action complaint was also filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Maryland on April 3, 2019, also on behalf of a putative class of Osiris' public shareholders. The nine complaints are captioned: Recupero v. Friedli, et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00870-ELH (D. Md.), Scarantino v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00876-DKC (D. Md.), Albrecht v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00903-ELH (D. Md.), Stein v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00907-JKB (D. Md.), Bartlome v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02657 (S.D.N.Y.), Salley v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02822 (S.D.N.Y), LaBarbara v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00993-ELH (D. Md.), Daly v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. C-13-CV-19-000338 (Md. Cir. Ct. Apr. 3, 2019) and Hazel v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01056-JKB (D. Md.). All nine complaints name as defendants the directors of Osiris, and Scarantino, Albrecht, Stein, Salley, LaBarbara, Bartlome, Daly and Hazel also name Osiris as a defendant. Stein, Scarantino and Daly further name Smith & Nephew, Parent and Purchaser as defendants.

The eight complaints filed in federal courts generally allege that Osiris and its directors violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose material information in the Schedule 14D-9. The Stein and Scarantino complaints further allege that the omissions constitute violations of federal securities laws by Smith & Nephew, Parent and Purchaser. The one complaint filed in Maryland state court alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Osiris stockholders. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief barring the proposed transaction, damages, and an award of plaintiffs' expenses and attorneys' fees. The defendants believe that the claims respectively asserted against them are without merit.

Osiris, Purchaser, Parent and Smith & Nephew continue to believe that all allegations in the complaints are without merit, and further believe that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable laws. However, Osiris wishes to make certain supplemental disclosures related to the Offer solely for the purpose of mooting the allegations contained in the Lawsuits and avoiding the expense and burden of litigation. Nothing in the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the supplemental disclosures.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The keyword ""class action"" is mentioned in the document, specifically in the following sentence:

""On March 29, 2019, a putative stockholder class action captioned Salley v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02822 was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.""

However, this sentence does not refer to the target case, which is Daly v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. C-13-cv-13-000338.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Although the keyword ""class action"" is mentioned, it does not refer to the target case. Therefore, I will proceed to the next step.

3. **Search for other keywords**: The document mentions that the complaint filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Maryland, which is the target case, is a ""putative stockholder class action"". This language suggests that the plaintiff is representing a class of similarly situated individuals.

Based on this language, I conclude that the case is likely a class action.

}",NOBLAW45179760,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis of the LLM's Response:**

1. **Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**: 
   - The LLM correctly identifies the presence of the term ""class action"" in a sentence related to a different case (Salley v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc.). This indicates the LLM is checking for the term but also correctly notes that it is not related to the target case (Daly v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc.).

2. **Confirm Class Action Mention**: 
   - The LLM appropriately acknowledges that although ""class action"" is mentioned elsewhere, it does not pertain to the target case and thus proceeds as per instructions.

3. **Search for Other Keywords**: 
   - The LLM finds the term ""putative stockholder class action"" in reference to the target case Daly v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., indicating that the complaint filed is likely a class action. The term ""putative"" suggests that the case is being asserted as a class action on behalf of a group of similarly situated individuals. This matches the criteria for indicating a class action under the given instructions.

**Evaluation of the Output**:
- The statement ""On April 3, 2019, a putative stockholder class action captioned Daly v. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. C-13-cv-13-000338 was filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Maryland"" is a direct quote from the excerpts signifying that the target case is identified as a ""putative stockholder class action.""
- The LLM correctly concludes that the case is ""Likely"" a class action based on the description provided, consistent with the task's instructions.

There is no hallucination in the LLM's response; it faithfully interprets and reports the information provided in the excerpts.

Proceedings Related to the Centene Transaction

Between May 7 and May 9, 2019, three putative class action lawsuits were filed by purported stockholders of WellCare against WellCare and members of the WellCare Board in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Stein v. WellCare Health Plans, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00855-LPS (""Stein v. WellCare""); Kent v. WellCare Health Plans, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00865-LPS (""Kent v. WellCare""); and Clarke v. WellCare Health Plans, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00873-LPS ""Clark v. WellCare""). The complaint in Kent v. WellCare also names Centene, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II as defendants. The complaints in Stein v. WellCare, Kent v. WellCare and Clark v. WellCare purport to assert claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allege that the Joint Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on May 23, 2019 contained certain material omissions.

In addition, on May 10, 2019, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a purported stockholder of WellCare against WellCare, members of the WellCare Board, Centene, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 in the Circuit Court of the 13th Judicial Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, Florida (Seabaugh v. WellCare Health Plans, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CA004942 (""Seabaugh v. WellCare"" and, together with Stein v. WellCare, Kent v. WellCare and Clark v. WellCare, the ""Lawsuits""). The complaint in Seabaugh v. WellCare alleges that members of the WellCare Board breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, agreeing to an allegedly unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that allegedly impede their ability to investigate or obtain higher offers, allegedly failing to protect against certain purported conflicts of interest, and allegedly failing to disclose material information in the Joint Proxy Statement. The complaint further alleges that WellCare, Centene, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks to enjoin or rescind the mergers and requests an award of attorneys' fees and damages in an unspecified amount.

On July 1, 2019, the plaintiffs in Stein v. WellCare and Kent v. WellCare filed notices of voluntary dismissal. On September 24, 2019, the plaintiff in Clark v. WellCare filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. On October 8, 2019, the plaintiff in Seabaugh v. WellCare filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.

Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement, the Proxy Statement and/or the Centene Transaction may be filed in the future. WellCare intends to vigorously defend against any lawsuits challenging the merger. However, there can be no assurance that defendants will be successful in the outcome of any potential future lawsuits. One of the conditions to completion of the Centene Transaction is the absence of any applicable injunction or other order being in effect that prohibits completion of the Centene Transaction. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Centene Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Centene Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.

Other Lawsuits and Claims

Based on the nature of our business, we are subject to regulatory reviews or other investigations by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and other state and federal regulatory authorities. These authorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance and benefits companies and their reviews focus on numerous facets of our business, including claims payment practices, provider contracting, competitive practices, commission payments, privacy issues and utilization management practices, among others. Some of these reviews have historically resulted in fines imposed on us and some have required changes to our business practices. We continue to be subject to such reviews, which may result in additional fines and/or sanctions being imposed, premium refunds or additional changes in our business practices.

No action in connection with this supplement to the Proxy Statement is required by any shareholder who previously delivered a proxy and who does not wish to revoke or change that proxy. Information about voting or revoking a proxy appears on page 11 of the Proxy Statement.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As described in the Proxy Statement, on June 19, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Keith v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that our Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed HPE transaction by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al., Case No. 19-2-05756-31 (the ""Delman Complaint""). Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 10, 2019, another similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Rapacki v. Cray, et al., Case No. 19-2-18093-5 SEA (the ""Rapacki Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint and the Delman Complaint, the ""State Court Actions"").

In addition, as described in the Proxy Statement, on June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA (the ""Stein Complaint"" and together with the Davie Complaint and Kent Complaint, the ""Delaware Complaints""). Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 2, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Epstein v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. Case No. 2:19-cv-01026-BJR (the ""Epstein Complaint"" and together with the Delaware Complaints, the ""Federal Court Actions"").

The Company is subject to patent lawsuits brought by Raytheon Company (""Raytheon""). A first suit was brought by Raytheon on September 25, 2015 in the Eastern District of Texas (Civil Action No. 2:15-cv-1554) asserting infringement of four patents owned by Raytheon (""First Action""). Two of the originally asserted patents relate to computer hardware alleged to be encompassed by Cray's current and past products (the ""Hardware Patents""), and the two remaining asserted patents relate to features alleged to be performed by certain third-party software that Cray optionally includes as part of its product offerings (the ""Software Patents""). A second suit was brought by Raytheon on April 22, 2016 in the Eastern District of Texas (Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-423) asserting infringement of five patents owned by Raytheon (""Second Action"". In the Second Action, all five asserted patents relate to features alleged to be performed by certain third-party software that Cray optionally includes as part of its product offerings. On September 21, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted Cray's petition for writ of mandamus and overturned the trial court's determination that venue in the First Action was proper in the Eastern District of Texas. Accordingly on April 5, 2018, the trial court ordered that the First Action should be transferred to the Western District of Wisconsin, as had been requested by Cray, which was effective on April 30, 2018 (Civil Action No. 3:18-cv-00318-wmc). After transfer, Raytheon indicated its desire to withdraw its claims for infringement of the Hardware Patents. The Wisconsin court, upon joint motion of the parties, dismissed with prejudice the counts related to the Hardware Patents, and Raytheon has served on the Company and filed with the court covenants not to sue for infringement of the Hardware Patents. The Texas court, upon joint motion of the parties, transferred the Second Action to the Northern District of California (Civil Action No. 3:18-cv-03388-RS). Per joint motion of the parties, the California court has stayed the Second Action pending resolution of the First Action. In the First Action, the Wisconsin court held a summary judgment hearing on January 10, 2019. Respecting Cray's contentions that Raytheon's claims of infringement of the Software Patents fail as a matter of law, on April 15, 2019, the Wisconsin court, by opinion and order, granted Cray's motion for summary judgment and directed judgment in favor of Cray regarding Raytheon's claims of infringement of the Software Patents. On May 15, 2019, Cray filed a motion seeking attorneys fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 which provides that the Court in ""exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party."" That motion is currently pending. On May 24, 2019, Raytheon filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the Wisconsin court's April 15, 2019 order granting Cray's motion for summary judgment that the Software Patents were not infringed. No decision on the appeal is expected until 2020. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these actions including the appeal of the favorable decision by the Wisconsin court in the First Action. The probable outcome of the described litigation cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss (or gain from a potential recovery of attorney's fees). Based on its review of the matters to date, the Company notes that its defenses have to date prevailed in the First Action, and the Company believes that it has valid defenses in the Second Action. As a result, the Company considers the likelihood of a material loss related to these matters to be remote.

The Company is also subject to putative shareholder class action lawsuits in connection with the Merger Agreement.

On June 19, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Keith v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that the Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction with HPE by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al., Case No. 19-2-05756-31 (the ""Delman Complaint""). On July 10, 2019, another similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Rapacki v. Cray, et al., Case No. 19-2-18093-5 SEA (the ""Rapacki Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint and the Delman Complaint, the ""State Court Actions"").

On June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA (the ""Stein Complaint"" and together with the Davie Complaint and Kent Complaint, the ""Delaware Complaints""). On July 2, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Epstein v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. [2:19-cv-01026] (the ""Epstein Complaint"" and together with the Delaware Complaints, the ""Federal Court Actions""). The Federal Court Actions each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

The State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the Merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. The probable outcome of the State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend those actions. As a result, the Company considers the likelihood of a material loss related to these matters to be remote.

Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that the Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed HPE transaction by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al. (the ""Delman Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint, the ""Washington Complaints"").

On June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA (the ""Stein Complaint"" and together with the Davie Complaint and Kent Complaint, the ""Delaware Complaints""). The Delaware Complaints each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

The Washington Complaints and Delaware Complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. Cray believes that the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend those actions. Cray may become subject to similar litigation relating to the merger in these or other jurisdictions.

```",NOBLAW98649477,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM's response contains any hallucinations based on the provided task instructions and excerpts.

Step 1: Search for keyword ""class action""
- The LLM correctly identifies the explicit mention of ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" related to the Keith Complaint, which is the target case.

Step 2: Confirm class action mention
- The LLM verifies that the ""class action"" keyword explicitly relates to the Keith Complaint. The statement provided by the LLM does exist in the filing excerpts.
- The LLM accurately quotes the section where the Keith Complaint is labeled as a ""putative shareholder class action complaint,"" confirming it pertains to the target case.

Step 3: Search for other keywords (if applicable)
- This step is not necessary because the LLM already confirmed the class action mention in the previous steps.

Step 4: Assess negative (if applicable)
- This step is not necessary because the LLM already established that the case is a class action.

Analysis of LLM's reasoning with task instructions:
- The LLM followed the instruction correctly. It identified the mention of ""class action"" in relation to the Keith Complaint and confirmed it as the target case.
- The LLM provided an accurate quote that linked the case to being a class action.
- Therefore, the LLM appropriately classified the Keith Complaint as a ""Yes"" for being a class action.

Based on the analysis, the LLM did not make any hallucination. Its response appropriately reflected the information available in the excerpts and followed the task instructions.

No action in connection with this supplement to the Proxy Statement is required by any shareholder who previously delivered a proxy and who does not wish to revoke or change that proxy. Information about voting or revoking a proxy appears on page 11 of the Proxy Statement.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As described in the Proxy Statement, on June 19, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Keith v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that our Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed HPE transaction by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al., Case No. 19-2-05756-31 (the ""Delman Complaint""). Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 10, 2019, another similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of our Board, captioned Rapacki v. Cray, et al., Case No. 19-2-18093-5 SEA (the ""Rapacki Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint and the Delman Complaint, the ""State Court Actions"").

In addition, as described in the Proxy Statement, on June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of our Board, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v.

Cray Inc., et al., Case No. Case No. 2:19-cv-01026-BJR (the ""Epstein Complaint"" and together with the Delaware Complaints, the ""Federal Court Actions""). The Federal Court Actions each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

2019-08-02 Form 10-Q [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/949158/000094915819000147/cray-6302019x10q.htm]:
The Company is subject to patent lawsuits brought by Raytheon Company (""Raytheon""). A first suit was brought by Raytheon on September 25, 2015 in the Eastern District of Texas (Civil Action No. 2:15-cv-1554) asserting infringement of four patents owned by Raytheon (""First Action""). Two of the originally asserted patents relate to computer hardware alleged to be encompassed by Cray's current and past products (the ""Hardware Patents""), and the two remaining asserted patents relate to features alleged to be performed by certain third-party software that Cray optionally includes as part of its product offerings (the ""Software Patents""). A second suit was brought by Raytheon on April 22, 2016 in the Eastern District of Texas (Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-423) asserting infringement of five patents owned by Raytheon (""Second Action"". In the Second Action, all five asserted patents relate to features alleged to be performed by certain third-party software that Cray optionally includes as part of its product offerings. On September 21, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted Cray's petition for writ of mandamus and overturned the trial court's determination that venue in the First Action was proper in the Eastern District of Texas. Accordingly on April 5, 2018, the trial court ordered that the First Action should be transferred to the Western District of Wisconsin, as had been requested by Cray, which was effective on April 30, 2018 (Civil Action No. 3:18-cv-00318-wmc). After transfer, Raytheon indicated its desire to withdraw its claims for infringement of the Hardware Patents. The Wisconsin court, upon joint motion of the parties, dismissed with prejudice the counts related to the Hardware Patents, and Raytheon has served on the Company and filed with the court covenants not to sue for infringement of the Hardware Patents. The Texas court, upon joint motion of the parties, transferred the Second Action to the Northern District of California (Civil Action No. 3:18-cv-03388-RS). Per joint motion of the parties, the California court has stayed the Second Action pending resolution of the First Action. In the First Action, the Wisconsin court held a summary judgment hearing on January 10, 2019. Respecting Cray's contentions that Raytheon's claims of infringement of the Software Patents fail as a matter of law, on April 15, 2019, the Wisconsin court, by opinion and order, granted Cray's motion for summary judgment and directed judgment in favor of Cray regarding Raytheon's claims of infringement of the Software Patents. On May 15, 2019, Cray filed a motion seeking attorneys fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 which provides that the Court in ""exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party."" That motion is currently pending. On May 24, 2019, Raytheon filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the Wisconsin court's April 15, 2019 order granting Cray's motion for summary judgment that the Software Patents were not infringed. No decision on the appeal is expected until 2020. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these actions including the appeal of the favorable decision by the Wisconsin court in the First Action. The probable outcome of the described litigation cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss (or gain from a potential recovery of attorney's fees). Based on its review of the matters to date, the Company notes that its defenses have to date prevailed in the First Action, and the Company believes that it has valid defenses in the Second Action. As a result, the Company considers the likelihood of a material loss related to these matters to be remote.

The Company is also subject to putative shareholder class action lawsuits in connection with the Merger Agreement.

On June 19, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Keith v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. 19-2-16273-2 SEA (the ""Keith Complaint""), asserting that the Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction with HPE by, among other things, allegedly conducting a flawed and conflicted sales process and by causing to be disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement. On June 24, 2019, a similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Snohomish County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Delman v. Ungaro, et al., Case No. 19-2-05756-31 (the ""Delman Complaint""). On July 10, 2019, another similar putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Rapacki v. Cray, et al., Case No. 19-2-18093-5 SEA (the ""Rapacki Complaint"" and together with the Keith Complaint and the Delman Complaint, the ""State Court Actions"").

On June 20, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against Cray, the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Davie v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01148-UNA (the ""Davie Complaint""). On June 21, 2019, another putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the same court against Cray, the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, HPE and Merger Sub, captioned Kent v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01157-UNA (the ""Kent Complaint""), and on June 24, 2019, an individual action was filed in the same court against the same defendants, captioned Stein v. Cray Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01188-UNA (the ""Stein Complaint"" and together with the Davie Complaint and Kent Complaint, the ""Delaware Complaints""). On July 2, 2019, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against Cray and the individual members of Cray's Board of Directors, captioned Epstein v. Cray Inc., et al., Case No. [2:19-cv-01026] (the ""Epstein Complaint"" and together with the Delaware Complaints, the ""Federal Court Actions""). The Federal Court Actions each assert that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

The State Court Actions and the Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the Merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I found multiple mentions of ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" in the filing excerpts, specifically in the descriptions of the Delman v. Ungaro, et al. case.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The mention of ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" in the context of the Delman v. Ungaro, et al. case confirms that this case is indeed a class action.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The LLM correctly identifies the keyword phrase ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" associated with the Delman v. Ungaro, et al. case in the filing excerpts. The excerpts explicitly mention this phrase multiple times, confirming the nature of the lawsuit as a class action.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The LLM also correctly confirms that the phrase ""putative shareholder class action complaint"" directly pertains to the Delman v. Ungaro, et al. case. Since this is the expected keyword that clarifies a class action, the LLM's conclusion aligns with the provided content.

Next, I will analyze whether the response diverges from the task instructions. The task instructions require confirming the class action status by identifying and confirming the presence of specific keywords or related language. The LLM response follows these instructions correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude the LLM did not make a hallucination.

As previously disclosed, on June 23, 2019, Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""DFRG"" or the ""Company"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among the Company, Harlan Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent""), and Harlan Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

On July 23, 2019, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a preliminary proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") related to a special meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held for the purpose of, among other things, voting on the Merger.

In connection with the Merger, after the Proxy Statement was filed, a putative class action complaint was filed in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, captioned Benjamin Palestino v. DFRG, Inc., et al., Case No. DC-19-10726 (the ""Complaint""). The Complaint was filed by a purported Company stockholder and is pending in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors. The Complaint alleges generally that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, including their duties of loyalty, good faith, candor, and due care, by, among other things, failing to obtain adequate, fair or maximum value for Company stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger.

The Complaint seeks, among other things, for the court to (i) declare that the action is properly maintainable as a class action, certify plaintiff as class representative and certify his counsel as class counsel, (ii) declare that the Merger Agreement was entered into in breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company's Board of Directors and is therefore unlawful and unenforceable, and rescind and invalidate the Merger Agreement and any other agreements that defendants entered into in connection with, or in furtherance of, the Merger, (iii) preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants from consummating the Merger, (iv) direct the defendants to exercise their fiduciary duties to obtain a transaction that is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, (v) impose a constructive trust, in favor of the plaintiff and the class, upon any benefits improperly received by the defendants as a result of their alleged wrongful conduct, and (vi) award costs and disbursements of this action (including attorneys' and experts' fees). Although the Complaint requests injunctive relief, the plaintiff has not filed a motion to enjoin the Merger at this time. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. Each of the defendants believes that the plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint lack merit and intend to vigorously defend against the Complaint and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaint which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As described in the Proxy Statement, on July 22, 2019, a stockholder complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, against us and the individual members of our Board, captioned Stein v. Shutterfly, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:19-cv-04203 (the ""Stein Complaint""). On July 23, 2019, a stockholder complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against us and the individual members of our Board, captioned Spurlock v. Shutterfly, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-06836 (the ""Spurlock Complaint""). On July 26, 2019, a putative stockholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, against us and the individual members of our Board, captioned Wolf v. Shutterfly, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01387 (the ""Wolf Complaint""). On July 29, 2019, a putative stockholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, against us and individual members of our Board, captioned Gordon v. Shutterfly, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-04335 (the ""Gordon Complaint"" and collectively with the Stein Complaint, Spurlock Complaint and Wolf Complaint, the ""Federal Court Complaints""). Each of the Federal Court Complaints asserts that defendants violated Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and certain rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement.

Subsequent to the filing of the Proxy Statement, on July 31, 2019, another putative stockholder class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, against us and the individual members of our Board, captioned Cheung v. Shutterfly, Inc. et al., Case No. 19-CIV-04419. That case has since been voluntarily dismissed by plaintiff. On August 5, 2019, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, captioned Cheung v. Shutterfly, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-04540 (the ""Federal Cheung Complaint""). Plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of that case.

The Stockholder Complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining defendants from consummating the merger, money damages and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

We believe that the claims asserted in the Stockholder Complaints are without merit and deny the allegations in each of those actions.

As previously disclosed, on July 15, 2019, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. (""United Financial"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with People's United Financial, Inc. (""People's United""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, United Financial will merge (the ""Merger"") with and into People's United, with People's United as the surviving corporation. On September 6, 2019, United Financial filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement"") with respect to the special meeting of United Financial shareholders scheduled to be held on October 22, 2019 in connection with the Merger (the ""Special Meeting"").

Litigation Related to the Combination

In connection with the Merger, six complaints were filed between September 10 and September 23, 2019 against one or more of United Financial, the directors of United Financial and People's United. Two complaints, captioned Paul Parshall v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et al., case number 1:19-cv-01716-UNA and Michael Gordon v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et. al., case number 1:19-cv-01787-UNA, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. One complaint, captioned Robert Browne v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et al., case number HHD-CV-19-6116910-S was filed in the State of Connecticut Superior Court. Two complaints, captioned William McGurk v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et al., case number 1:19-cv-08462 and Francis O'Connor v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et al., case number 1:19-cv-08532, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and one complaint, captioned Marianne Kochanek v. United Financial Bancorp, Inc., et. al., case number 1:19-cv-05388, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Browne, Gordon and Parshall complaints seek to assert claims on behalf of a putative class of United Financial shareholders.

The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the registration statement filed by People's United in connection with the Merger and the Definitive Proxy Statement filed by United Financial are materially incomplete and misleading, supposedly in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") or, in the case of the Browne action, state law fiduciary duties. The actions purport to seek, among other relief, to enjoin the Special Meeting unless and until the allegedly missing material information is disclosed to the United Financial shareholders and, in some instances, money damages in the event that the Merger is consummated.

United Financial believes that no additional disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws, and that no laws or duties were breached in connection with the Merger or the Definitive Proxy Statement. However, to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to avoid any potential delay of the consummation of the Merger, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, United Financial decided to make certain supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement as set forth below.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and found no explicit mentions of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" I found the following sentence: ""The Browne, Gordon and Parshall complaints seek to assert claims on behalf of a putative class of United Financial shareholders."" Although this sentence mentions ""putative class,"" it does not directly state that the Robert Browne case is a class action. However, it does imply that the case is a class action.

Since the sentence provides explicit and direct evidence that the plaintiff is on behalf of others similarly situated, and that the language is about the cases including the target case, I conclude that the case is likely a class action.

}
```",X1Q6O4FREEO2,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step, in accordance with the task instructions and provided excerpts.

### Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit mention of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms within the document.

### Step 2: Search for Other Keywords

The LLM finds the sentence: 
""The Browne, Gordon and Parshall complaints seek to assert claims on behalf of a putative class of United Financial shareholders.""

This sentence indicates that the complaints, including the Browne complaint (which is the target case), aim to assert claims on behalf of a putative class. This suggests that the case is brought on behalf of a broader group, aligning with the characteristics of a class action.

### Evaluation Against Instructions

- **Misinterpretation**: The key phrase ""putative class of United Financial shareholders"" directly implies an intention to file a class action suit. The term ""putative class"" is commonly used in class action contexts to describe a class that is proposed or alleged but not yet certified by a court. Therefore, the LLM's interpretation that the case is ""Likely"" a class action is consistent with the instructions, as the language provides explicit and direct evidence that the plaintiff is acting on behalf of others similarly situated.

- **Correct Classification**: Given the language used in the excerpt, the LLM accurately classifies the case as ""Likely"" a class action. 

### Conclusion
There are no hallucinations in the LLM's response. It correctly identifies and interprets relevant language in the excerpt, aligning well with the guidelines provided in the task instructions.

The complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the proposed Merger; in the event the proposed Merger is consummated, an order rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages; an order directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not contain purportedly misleading statements or material omissions; and unspecified attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company believes that the allegations against it lack merit, however, there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will prevail. It is possible that additional lawsuits may be filed in connection with the proposed merger.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On October 4, 2019 and October 11, 2019, purported shareholders of SRC filed putative class action lawsuits against the members of the SRC board, SRC, and PDC in Colorado District Court in Arapahoe County and Denver County, captioned Robert Garfield v. Lynn A. Peterson, et al., Case No. 2019CV32360 and George Korol v. SRC Energy Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV33933. The plaintiffs in the state law complaints generally claim that (i) SRC and the members of the SRC board breached their fiduciary duties to SRC shareholders by authorizing the merger with PDC for what the plaintiffs assert is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an unfair process and with inadequate disclosures and (ii) PDC aided and abetted the other defendants' alleged breach of duties. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, to rescind the transaction or obtain rescissory damages if the merger is consummated, to recover other unspecified damages, including recover attorneys' fees and costs, and to obtain injunctive relief.

On October 8, 2019 and October 11, 2019, purported shareholders of SRC filed putative class action lawsuits against SRC, the members of the SRC board, and PDC in the United States District Court, District of Delaware, captioned Patrick Plumley v. SRC Energy Inc., et al., Case No. 1:99-mc-01912 and Juan Aguirre v. SRC Energy Inc., et al., Case No. 1:99-mc-01934. On November 8, 2019, purported shareholders of SRC filed putative class action lawsuits against SRC and the members of the SRC board in the United States District Court, District of Colorado, captioned Waynick v. SRC Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-03173 and Ben-Yosef v. SRC Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-03182. The plaintiffs in the federal law complaints generally claim that the defendants disseminated a false or misleading registration statement regarding the proposed merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and/or Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent consummation of the merger until the alleged disclosure violations are cured, damages in the event the merger is consummated, and an award of attorney's fees.

The defendants believe that these actions are without merit.

If a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger in the state law complaints, federal law complaints, or any other similar lawsuits, then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed, which may adversely affect PDC's and SRC's respective business, financial position and results of operation.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The mentions of ""class action"" are in the context of the lawsuits, specifically stating that the plaintiffs filed ""putative class action lawsuits"". This confirms that the case of interest, George Korol v. SRC Energy Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV33933, is indeed a class action.

Item 8.01 | Other Events

As previously disclosed, on August 15, 2019, Bancorp of New Jersey, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the ""Company"") and ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (""ConnectOne""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into ConnectOne (the ""Merger"").

On October 18, 2019, an action captioned Paul Parshall v. Bancorp of New Jersey, Inc. et al., Docket No. C-276-19 (the ""Action""), was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, Chancery Division, on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders against the Company, its current directors and ConnectOne (collectively, the ""Defendants""). The complaint in the Action alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by ConnectOne on September 27, 2019 in connection with the Merger (as amended, the ""Registration Statement"") omits material information with respect to the Merger, and therefore the plaintiff in the Action asserts causes of action alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties by the Defendants.

The Defendants believe that the Action is entirely without merit, and deny that any further disclosure beyond that already contained in the Registration Statement is required under applicable law to supplement the Registration Statement, and the joint proxy statement included therein, which has subsequently been disseminated to Company and ConnectOne shareholders. Nevertheless, to avoid the risk that the Action may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the Merger and to minimize the expense of defending such Action, the Defendants are making the following supplemental disclosures (the ""Litigation-Related Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the Litigation-Related Supplemental Disclosures set forth herein.

The Litigation-Related Supplemental Disclosures supplement the proxy statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on October 22, 2019 (the ""Proxy Statement"") and should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which Proxy Statement should be read in its entirety, along with periodic reports and other information the Company has filed with the SEC. To the extent that the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained in the Proxy Statement, the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the Proxy Statement. All page references below are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined herein, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement.

- **case number**: C-276-19

</target_case>
","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders"" in the following sentence:

""On October 18, 2019, an action captioned Paul Parshall v. Bancorp of New Jersey, Inc. et al., Docket No. C-276-19 (the ""Action""), was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, Chancery Division, on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders against the Company, its current directors and ConnectOne (collectively, the ""Defendants"").""

However, this sentence does not explicitly state that the case is a class action. It only mentions that the plaintiff is acting on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: Since the keyword ""class action"" is not explicitly mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

3. **Search for other keywords**: The sentence mentioned in step 1 contains the phrase ""on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders"", which suggests that the plaintiff is representing a group of similarly situated individuals. This language provides explicit and direct evidence that the plaintiff is acting on behalf of others.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the case is likely a class action.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```

    ""quote"": ""On October 18, 2019, an action captioned Paul Parshall v.

    ""is_class_action"": ""Likely"",
    ""note"": ""The plaintiff is acting on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders.""
}
```",NOBLAW95572717,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis of LLM Response:**

Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""
- The LLM correctly identified a sentence that mentions ""on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders."" 
- However, the LLM acknowledges that the specific phrase ""class action"" is not present in the document.

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention
- Since there is no direct mention of ""class action,"" the LLM correctly moves on to considering other linguistic indicators of a class action.

Step 3: Search for Other Keywords
- The LLM identifies the phrase ""on behalf of a purported class of Company shareholders"" as suggestive of class action status.
- According to the instructions, if such language is found, it can suggest that the case is likely a class action. The LLM accurately interprets this phrase as indicating the plaintiff is acting on behalf of others similarly situated.

Output:
- Based on these factors, the LLM concludes that the case is ""Likely"" a class action. This is consistent with the instructions provided.

Conclusion:
- The LLM's logical progression and interpretation were consistent with the original task instructions. 
- The LLM did not create any non-existent facts or misinterpret the provided information.

On October 24, 2019, Shiva Stein, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company and the members of the board in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, styled Stein v. Arotech Corporation, C.A. No. 1:19-cv-02016-RGA (the ""Stein Action""). Stein alleges that the Company and the board violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") by failing to disclose material information in connection with financial projections and inputs relied upon by B. Riley in its analyses, including (i) certain non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation to GAAP, (ii) certain inputs or analyses relating to B. Riley's Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, and (iii) the premiums paid in the transactions observed in B. Riley's Premiums Paid Analysis. Stein seeks to, among other things, enjoin the consummation of the merger until such disclosures are made, rescind, to the extent already implemented, the merger agreement, or obtain damages.

On October 28, 2019, Eric Sabatini filed a purported stockholder class action against the Company and the members of the board in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, styled Sabatini v. Arotech Corporation, C.A. No. 1:19-cv-02028-RGA (the ""Sabatini Action""). On October 30, 2019, Jacqueline D. Creeks, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company, the members of the board, Dean M. Krutty, and Kelli L. Kellar in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, styled Creeks v. Arotech Corporation, C.A. No. 1:19-cv-10044 (the ""Creeks Action""). Sabatini and Creeks assert similar allegations to those in the Stein Action and seek similar relief.

On October 31, 2019, David Hill filed a purported stockholder class action against the Company and the members of the board in the Circuit Court for Washtenaw County in the State of Michigan, styled Hill v. Arotech, Inc., Case No 19-001185-CB (the ""Hill Action""). Hill alleges that the members of the board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose purportedly material information, including the information sought in the Stein Action, Sabatini Action, and Creeks Action, and information relating to the sales process, such as details regarding certain confidentiality agreements, the reason for forming the special committee, and the scope of the special committee's authority. Hill also alleges that the members of the board breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in a purportedly deficient sales process resulting in a purportedly unfair price. Hill further alleges that the members of the board labored under a conflict of interest as a result of the accelerated vesting of certain equity. Finally, Hill claims that the Company aided and abetted those purported breaches. Hill seeks similar relief to the relief sought in the Stein Action, Sabatini Action, and Creeks Action.

The outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty; however, we and our board believe that the allegations and claims asserted in the Stein Action, Sabatini Action, Creeks Action, and Hill Action are without merit. A negative outcome in the actions could adversely affect us if it results in preliminary or permanent injunctive relief.

However, this sentence does not refer to the target case, Hill v. Arotech, Inc., Case No. 19-001185-CB.

This sentence explicitly states that the Hill Action is a ""purported stockholder class action"".

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The mention of ""class action"" in the sentence indeed refers to the target case, Hill v. Arotech, Inc., Case No. 19-001185-CB.

**Step 1: Check for Class Action Mention**

- The LLM correctly identifies two sentences where ""class action"" is mentioned.
    - The first sentence is related to the Sabatini Action, which is not the target case, so it is irrelevant for confirming if the Hill Action is a class action.
    - The second sentence explicitly mentions the Hill Action (the target case), stating it is a ""purported stockholder class action.""
- The LLM has correctly confirmed that the ""class action"" keyword refers to the target case.

**Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention**

- The LLM correctly confirms that the mention of ""class action"" indeed refers to the Hill Action, which is the target case. This satisfies the task instructions to confirm if the target case is a class action.

**Step 3: JSON Output**

- The LLM provides a JSON object with the correct classification (""Yes"") for the ""is_class_action"" field, accompanied by the correct quote from the filing excerpts, matching the task instructions.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the LLM did not contradict, misinterpret, or diverge from the task instructions. The mention of the ""class action"" keyword pertaining to the target case was accurately identified and confirmed.

Hill seeks similar relief to the relief sought in the Stein Action, Lasker Action, Sabatini Action, Creeks Action, and Fisher Action.

By adding the following paragraph after the third paragraph under the heading ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"" on page 8:

On November 13, 2019, Attilio Girardi, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company, the members of its board, and Greenbriar Equity Group, L.P. in the Circuit Court for Washtenaw County in the State of Michigan, styled Girardi v. Jon B. Kutler, C.A. No. 19-01228-CB (the ""Girardi Action""). The Girardi Action includes claims for breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting, and unjust enrichment. Girardi claims to bring his claims both on behalf of a class of stockholders and derivatively. Girardi's allegations are most similar to those in the Hill action, and he seeks similar relief to the relief sought in the Stein, Lasker, Sabatini, Creeks, Fisher, and Hill Actions.

By replacing the first sentence of the last paragraph under the heading ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"" on page 8 with the following sentence:

The outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty; however, we and our board believe that the allegations and claims asserted in the Stein Action, Lasker Action, Sabatini Action, Creeks Action, Fisher Action, Hill Action, and Girardi Action are without merit.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: I reviewed the document and found no explicit mention of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms.

2. **Search for other keywords**: I looked for other explicit language stating that the plaintiff is ""on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" I found the following sentence:

""Girardi claims to bring his claims both on behalf of a class of stockholders and derivatively.""

This sentence provides explicit and direct evidence that the plaintiff is on behalf of others similarly situated.

3. **Assess negative**: Since I found a relevant keyword, I do not need to assess negative.

Based on the analysis, I conclude that the case is likely a class action.

Here is the output in JSON format:

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The LLM correctly identified that there is no explicit mention of ""class action,"" ""class certification,"" or similar terms in the provided excerpts.

2. **Search for other keywords**: The LLM searches for other explicit language suggesting the case might be a class action. It finds the sentence, ""Girardi claims to bring his claims both on behalf of a class of stockholders and derivatively."" 

- This sentence does indeed suggest that the plaintiff, Girardi, is bringing his claims on behalf of a class, implying a class action. This aligns with the instructions to identify language stating that the plaintiff is on behalf of others similarly situated.

3. **Assess negative**: The LLM correctly did not proceed to assess negative, as it already found sufficient evidence to classify the case.

4. **Conclusion and classification**: The LLM classifies the case as ""Likely"" a class action based on the extracted quote. This is consistent with the instructions because it found explicit language that suggests class representation.

In conclusion, the LLM correctly interpreted the excerpts and followed the task instructions without introducing any contradictions or misinterpretations.

As previously disclosed, on October 14, 2019, Jagged Peak Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Jagged Peak""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among Parsley Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parsley""), and Jackal Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parsley (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Jagged Peak, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the ""Merger""), with Jagged Peak continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Jagged Peak would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parsley. On November 26, 2019, Jagged Peak filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a Definitive Proxy Statement for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the special meeting of Jagged Peak's stockholders, to be held on January 9, 2020, to vote upon, among other things, matters necessary to complete the Merger (the ""Proxy Statement"").

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, six purported stockholders of Jagged Peak filed separate complaints (including several putative class actions complaints, on behalf of themselves and all owners of Jagged Peak's common stock, other than defendants and related or affiliated persons) against Jagged Peak and the directors of Jagged Peak. The six complaints (collectively referred to as the ""Stockholder Actions"") are captioned as follows: Eric Sabatini v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02114 (D. Del.) (the ""Sabatini Action""), Jean-Pierre Enguehard v. Jagged Peak Energy, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-cv-34328 (Distr. Ct., Denver, CO) (the ""Enguehard Action""), Kelly Small v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-10698 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Small Action""), Sherrie Wynne v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-03281 (D. Colo.) (the ""Wynne Action""), Mark Prinzel v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-10886 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Prinzel Action""), and Stephen Bushansky v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-3433 (D. Colo.) (the ""Bushansky Action"").

The Stockholder Actions allege that, among other things, the Proxy Statement fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act. The Enguehard Action further alleges that the directors of Jagged Peak failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger by purportedly initiating a process to sell Jagged Peak in a transaction that undervalues Jagged Peak. The complaints seek injunctive relief enjoining the Merger and damages and costs, among other remedies. Copies of the complaint in each of the Stockholder Actions are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5 and 99.6, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein.

It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above may be amended. If this occurs, Jagged Peak does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains materially new or different allegations. Although Jagged Peak cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from these matters, Jagged Peak and Jagged Peak's defendant directors believe that these complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend them.

Following the public announcement of the merger, four putative stockholder lawsuits related to the merger were filed.

On November 8, 2019, Eric Sabatini, a purported Jagged Peak stockholder, filed a putative class action complaint, Sabatini v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Docket No. 1 19-cv-02114, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, on behalf of Jagged Peak stockholders against Jagged Peak, Parsley, Merger Sub, James J. Kleckner and the members of the Jagged Peak board (which we refer to as the ""Sabatini lawsuit""). The Sabatini lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed in connection with the merger fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9. The Sabatini lawsuit seeks injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs and other remedies.

On November 12, 2019, Jean-Pierre Enguehard, a purported Jagged Peak stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, Enguehard v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Docket No. 2019-cv-34328, in the District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado, on behalf of Jagged Peak stockholders against Jagged Peak, Parsley, Merger Sub, James J. Kleckner and the members of the Jagged Peak board (which we refer to as the ""Enguehard lawsuit""). The Enguehard lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the Jagged Peak board breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by failing to ensure that Jagged Peak stockholders will receive the maximum value for their shares, by failing to conduct an appropriate sale process, by the Jagged Peak board having conflicts of interest in connection with the merger, and by causing an allegedly misleading and incomplete registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the merger to be filed. Parsley and Merger Sub are alleged to have aided and abetted the alleged fiduciary breaches. The Enguehard lawsuit seeks injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs and other remedies.

On November 19, 2019, Kelly Small, a purported Jagged Peak stockholder, filed a complaint, Small v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-10698, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Jagged Peak, James J. Kleckner and the members of the Jagged Peak board (which we refer to as the ""Small lawsuit""). The Small lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed in connection with the merger fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9. The Small lawsuit seeks injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs and other remedies.

On November 20, 2019, Sherry Wynne, a purported Jagged Peak stockholder, filed a complaint, Wynne v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-03281, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, against Jagged Peak and the members of the Jagged Peak board (which we refer to as the ""Wynne lawsuit""). The Wynne lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 filed in connection with the merger fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9. The Wynne lawsuit seeks injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs and other remedies.

The statement regarding the Enguehard lawsuit explicitly states, ""On November 12, 2019, Jean-Pierre Enguehard, a purported Jagged Peak stockholder filed a putative class action complaint, Enguehard v. Jagged Peak Energy Inc. et al."" This indicates that the lawsuit is indeed a class action since it is described as such in the notation and directly links to the target case.

The LLM accurately identified and quoted this sentence, confirming the case as a class action.

As previously disclosed, several lawsuits were filed in federal court related to the Mergers: Shiva Stein v. Liberty Property Trust Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-03428, an individual action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland; John Thompson v. Liberty Property Trust, et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02230, a class action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; and Berlinger v. Liberty Property Trust et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-03562, an individual action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally allege that the Company and Prologis violated federal securities laws by omitting from the Form S-4, and/or misrepresenting in the Form S-4, material information, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient.

Following the filing of the proxy statement/prospectus, three additional lawsuits were filed in federal court, in which the plaintiffs asserted claims generally similar to those asserted in the prior federal cases: McDonough v. Liberty Property Trust et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-21582, an individual action filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; Hagerty v. Liberty Property Trust et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-11679, an individual action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and Yonchuk v. Liberty Property Trust, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00033, an individual action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.

In addition on December 16, 2019, a putative class action captioned Robert Garfield v. William P. Hankowsky et al., No. 2019-cv-9529-cv was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Defendants removed that action to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on January 6, 2020, and plaintiff subsequently voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice. On January 7, 2020, the same plaintiff filed a second putative class action captioned Robert Garfield v. William P. Hankowsky, et al., No. 2020-cv-123-cv, in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Defendants again removed that action to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where it was captioned Robert Garfield v. William P. Hankowsky, et al., CA No. 1:20-CV-27 (the ""Garfield Action""). The complaint in the Garfield Action alleges that the Company's board violated its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders in connection with the proposed Mergers, and that Prologis aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duty. As a result of the supplemental disclosures set forth herein, the plaintiff in the Garfield Action has agreed to dismiss his action with prejudice as to himself and without prejudice as to the remainder of the purported class.

The defendants believe that the lawsuits described above are without merit, and that no further disclosure is required under applicable law. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the supplemental disclosures set forth herein.

The supplemental disclosures contained below should be read in conjunction with the proxy statement/prospectus, which is available on the Internet site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov, along with periodic reports and other information the Company files with the SEC. To the extent that the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained in the proxy statement/prospectus the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the proxy statement/prospectus. All page references are to pages in the proxy statement/prospectus, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus.

However, this sentence refers to a different case (No. 2019-cv-9529-cv) than the target case (2020-cv-123-cv). 

But then I found another sentence that mentions ""putative class action"" with the correct case number:

On February 28, 2017 and March 6, 2017, respectively, two lawsuits, Sara Cilloni and Simone Zimmer v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., and Theodore Broomfield v. Kona Brewing Co. LLC, Kona Brew Enterprises, LLP, Kona Brewery LLC, and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern Division of California. On April 7, 2017, the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single complaint under the Broomfield case. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants misled customers regarding the state in which Kona Brewing Company beers are manufactured. On May 30, 2019, we announced our entry into a definitive settlement agreement, which received preliminary approval from the Court on June 14, 2019. The settlement claims period ended October 7, 2019, and the Court entered a Final Judgment on February 11, 2020. A notice of appeal of the final judgment was filed by an objector on March 3, 2020. On June 30, 2020, the Court approved a settlement with the objector and the appeal was dismissed. We recorded a charge of $4.7 million on a pre-tax basis in the quarter ended March 31, 2019, based on our estimate of the probable costs of settling the litigation. The total cost of settling the litigation is currently expected to be approximately $4.4 million.

In connection with the pending merger transaction with ABC, several lawsuits were filed on behalf of our shareholders. On January 3, 2020, a purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders, captioned Kost et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-2-00389-1 SEA, was filed in the Superior Court of Washington, King County (the ""Kost Action""). On January 14, 2020, a second purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders, captioned Birkby v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20CV02867, was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah (the ""Birkby Action""). On July 9, 2020, a third purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders, captioned Malloy v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20CV23549, was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah (the ""Malloy Action""). The Birkby, Malloy and Kost Actions assert state law claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty against our company and our directors, and the Birkby and Malloy Actions also assert claims against our Chief Executive Officer and ABC. The Malloy and Kost Actions also include allegations of material misstatements and omissions in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020 (the ""Proxy Statement"").

In addition, four complaints were filed in federal court asserting claims against our company and our directors under the federal securities laws and alleging material misstatements and omissions in the Proxy Statement: Sabatini et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00138, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on January 29, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders (the ""Sabatini Action""), Halberstam v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-01243, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 7, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder (the ""Halberstam Action""), Michael Roberts et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00208, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 12, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders (the ""Michael Roberts Action""), and Dennis Roberts v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00337, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on February 10, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder (the ""Dennis Roberts Action""). The Sabatini Action also asserts claims against ABC and a subsidiary of ABC.

On February 18, 2020, we announced the resolution of claims with the plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions, whereby we filed supplemental disclosures and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions dismissed their individual claims with prejudice, and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, and Michael Roberts Actions dismissed their class claims without prejudice. We did not view the supplemental disclosures as material or required by applicable law, but determined to make the disclosures in order to avoid the expense and risks inherent in further litigation. On April 1, 2020, plaintiff in the Dennis Roberts Action dismissed his case without prejudice.

In addition, four complaints were filed in federal court asserting claims against our company and our directors under the federal securities laws and alleging material misstatements and omissions in the Proxy Statement: Sabatini et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00138, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on January 29, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders (the ""Sabatini Action""), Halberstam v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-01243, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 7, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder (the ""Halberstam Action""), Michael Roberts et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00208, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 12, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of our shareholders (the ""Michael Roberts Action""), and Dennis Roberts v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00337, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on February 10, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder (the ""Dennis Roberts Action""). The Sabatini Action also asserts claims against ABC and a subsidiary of ABC.

On February 18, 2020, we announced the resolution of claims with the plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions, whereby we filed supplemental disclosures and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions dismissed their individual claims with prejudice, and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, and Michael Roberts Actions dismissed their class claims without prejudice. The Birkby and Dennis Roberts Actions have not been resolved. We did not view the supplemental disclosures as material or required by applicable law, but determined to make the disclosures in order to avoid the expense and risks inherent in further litigation.

On February 28, 2017 and March 6, 2017, respectively, two lawsuits, Sara Cilloni and Simone Zimmer v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., and Theodore Broomfield v. Kona Brewing Co. LLC, Kona Brew Enterprises, LLP, Kona Brewery LLC, and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern Division of California. On April 7, 2017, the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single complaint under the Broomfield case. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants misled customers regarding the state in which Kona Brewing Company beers are manufactured. On May 30, 2019, we announced our entry into a definitive settlement agreement, which received preliminary approval from the Court on June 14, 2019. The settlement claims period ended October 7, 2019, and the Court entered a Final Judgment on February 11, 2020. A notice of appeal of the final judgment was filed by an objector on March 3, 2020. We recorded a charge of $4.7 million on a pre-tax basis in the quarter ended March 31, 2019, based on our estimate of the probable costs of settling the litigation. The total cost of settling the litigation is expected to be approximately $4.4 million.

In connection with the Merger, several lawsuits were filed on behalf of shareholders of the Company. On January 3, 2020, a purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders, captioned Kost et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-2-00389-1 SEA, was filed in the Superior Court of Washington, King County (the ""Kost Action""). On January 14, 2020, a second purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders, captioned Birkby v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20CV02867, was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah (the ""Birkby Action""). The Birkby and Kost Actions assert state law claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty against the Company and its directors. The Kost Action also brings claims against the Company's Chief Executive Officer and ABC, and includes allegations of material misstatements and omissions in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020 (the ""Proxy Statement"").

In addition, four complaints were filed in federal court asserting claims against the Company and its directors under the federal securities laws and alleging material misstatements and omissions in the Company's Proxy Statement: Sabatini et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00138, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on January 29, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders (the ""Sabatini Action""), Halberstam v.

The Sabatini Action also brings claims against ABC and Merger Sub.

On February 18, 2020, the Company announced the resolution of claims with the plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions, whereby the Company filed supplemental disclosures and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions agreed to dismiss their individual claims with prejudice, and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, and Michael Roberts Actions agreed to dismiss their class claims without prejudice. The Birkby and Dennis Roberts Actions have not been resolved.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (""CBA"" or the ""Company"") previously announced its entry into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 11, 2019, by and among the Company, Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""A-B""), and Barrel Subsidiary, Inc., a Washington corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of A-B (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of A-B.

In connection with the Merger, the Company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") on January 21, 2020. As disclosed in the Proxy Statement, on January 3, 2020, a lawsuit relating to the Merger was filed in the Superior Court of Washington, King County--a purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders, captioned Kost et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-2-00389-1 SEA (the ""Kost Action""). As also disclosed in the Proxy Statement, on January 14, 2020, a second purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders, captioned Birkby et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20CV02867, was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah.

Following the filing of the Proxy Statement and prior to the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, four additional complaints were filed, alleging substantially similar claims: Sabatini et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00138, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on January 29, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders (the ""Sabatini Action""), Halberstam v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-01243, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 7, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder (the ""Halberstam Action""), Michael Roberts et al. v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00208, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 12, 2020 on behalf of a putative class of the Company's shareholders (the ""Michael Roberts Action""), and Dennis Roberts v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00337, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on February 10, 2020 on behalf of an individual shareholder.

The Company believes that the claims asserted in the above-referenced actions are without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to moot unmeritorious disclosure claims, to avoid the risk of the actions delaying or adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. In light of the supplemental disclosures, plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, Halberstam, and Michael Roberts Actions have agreed to dismiss their individual claims with prejudice, and plaintiffs in the Kost, Sabatini, and Michael Roberts Actions have agreed to dismiss their class claims without prejudice. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the actions, including allegations that any additional disclosure was or is required, and believes that the supplemental disclosures contained herein are immaterial.

The merger is not subject to any financing condition. The Company estimates that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions will be approximately $228,000,000. For a further discussion, see ""Special Factors--Financing of the Merger.""

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Two purported class action complaints related to the merger have been filed on behalf of putative classes of CBA's public shareholders: Steven Kost v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-2-00389-1 SEA, filed January 3, 2020, in the Superior Court of Washington, King County; and Evan Birkby v. Craft Brew Alliance, Inc., et al., Case No. 20CV02867, filed January 14, 2020, in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah. Both complaints name as defendants CBA and its directors, and the Birkby complaint also names as defendants Andrew J. Thomas and A-B. The complaints generally allege that CBA's directors breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly failing to establish a fair process to maximize the value of CBA to its public shareholders, by allegedly agreeing to the merger with A-B without regard for purported detrimental effects on CBA's public shareholders, and by allegedly failing to disclose material information in the preliminary form of this proxy statement. The Birkby complaint also alleges that Andrew J. Thomas as an officer of CBA and A-B as a significant shareholder of CBA breached fiduciary duties owed to CBA's public shareholders, and that all of the named defendants aided and abetted one another in breaching fiduciary duties owed to CBA's public shareholders. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger, rescission of the merger if consummated, damages, and an award of plaintiffs' expenses and attorneys' fees.

The Merger Agreement (page 63)

A summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, is described under ""The Merger Agreement."" Among other things, the merger agreement includes the following terms:

Legal and Regulatory Matters

Order Routing Matters - In 2014, five putative class action complaints were filed regarding TD Ameritrade, Inc.'s routing of client orders and one putative class action was filed regarding Scottrade, Inc.'s routing of client orders. Five of the six cases were dismissed and the United States Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, affirmed the dismissals in those cases that were appealed. The one remaining case is Roderick Ford (replacing Gerald Klein) v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, et al., Case No. 8:14CV396 (U.S. District Court, District of Nebraska). In the remaining case, plaintiff alleges that, when routing client orders to various market centers, defendants did not seek best execution, and instead routed clients' orders to market venues that paid TD Ameritrade, Inc. the most money for order flow. Plaintiff alleges that defendants made misrepresentations and omissions regarding the Company's order routing practices. The complaint asserts claims of violations of Section 10(b) and 20 of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief, and other relief. Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification, which defendants opposed. On July 12, 2018, the Magistrate Judge issued findings and a recommendation that plaintiff's motion for class certification be denied. Plaintiff filed objections to the Magistrate Judge's findings and recommendation, which defendants opposed. On September 14, 2018, the District Judge sustained plaintiff's objections, rejected the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On September 28, 2018, defendants filed a petition requesting that the U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, grant an immediate appeal of the District Court's class certification decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, granted defendants' petition on December 18, 2018. Briefing on the appeal is complete. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of the Company's appeal. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit and is unable to predict the outcome or the timing of the ultimate resolution of the lawsuit, or the potential loss, if any, that may result.

Litigation Relating to the Merger - On May 12, 2020, a putative class action complaint challenging the Merger was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint is captioned Hawkes v. Bettino et al., case number 2020-0306-PAF, and names as Defendants each member of the Company's board of directors who was on the Company's board of directors when the Merger Agreement was approved, TD and Schwab. Among other things, the complaint asserts a claim against such directors alleging that the Merger violates Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the ""Section 203 Claim"") and that the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus fails to disclose that the Merger does not comply with Section 203, which the complaint claims is a material omission. The complaint also alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty against members of the Company's board of directors who the Plaintiff alleges are affiliated with TD and against TD as the Company's alleged controlling stockholder, relating to the insured deposit account agreement entered into between Schwab and TD. The complaint further alleges a claim against Schwab for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint sought to enjoin the Company's stockholder vote on and consummation of the Merger and seeks an award of damages.

On May 12, 2020, the Plaintiff also filed (i) a motion seeking to preliminarily enjoin the Company's stockholder vote on the Merger on the grounds that the Merger is subject to the business combination restrictions of Section 203, and (ii) a motion for expedited proceedings, which asked the Court to set a preliminary injunction hearing on this Section 203 Claim in advance of the Company's stockholder vote on the Merger. On May 15, 2020, the Court held a hearing on the Plaintiff's motion for expedited proceedings. The Court granted the Plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery, but declined to hold any injunction hearing on the Plaintiff's Section 203 Claim prior to the Company's June 4, 2020 special meeting. On May 22, 2020, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission providing the Company's stockholders with certain Section 203-related disclosures and asking stockholders to approve the Merger by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock not deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203. On May 26, 2020, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a stipulation that, among other things, provided that if the Merger received the requisite stockholder support contemplated by Section 203, Plaintiff would dismiss his Section 203 Claim as moot and withdraw his application for a preliminary injunction. At the Company's June 4, 2020 special meeting, the votes cast in favor of the Merger represented in excess of 662/3% of the outstanding Common Stock not allegedly deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203. Accordingly, on June 11, 2020, Plaintiff dismissed his Section 203 claim as moot and withdrew his preliminary injunction motion. The Defendants intend to defend vigorously against the remaining claims alleged in the complaint and believe that the claims are without merit.

In addition, as previously disclosed, eight complaints were filed by purported stockholders of the Company in federal court challenging the Merger, including (i) Kent v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 1:20-cv-00388, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; (ii) Stein v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 1:20-cv-00410, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; (iii) Roth v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 2:20-cv-03425, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; (iv) Litwin v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 2:20-cv-03569, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; (v) Bernstein v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 2:20-cv-03695, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; (vi) Garrison v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 1:20-cv-02850, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; (vii) Paine-Mantha v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 1:20-cv-00637, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware; and (viii) Kong v. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation et al., case number 2:20-cv-05970, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, which complaints are collectively referred to as the federal actions. The complaints named as defendants, the Company and members of its board of directors and, in the case of two of the actions, Schwab. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the defendants authorized the filing of a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement. In addition to costs and attorneys' fees, the lawsuits sought to enjoin the vote of the Company's stockholders and the closing of the acquisition; and in the event the transaction were consummated, to set aside the transaction and/or obtain rescissionary or other damages. The Company believes that the claims asserted in the lawsuits were without merit and that that no further disclosure was required to supplement the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus under applicable law. On May 27, 2020, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission voluntarily making supplemental disclosures related to the Merger. In light of the supplemental disclosures, the plaintiffs in the federal actions agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice. As of July 14, 2020, all of the federal actions have been voluntarily dismissed.

TD Ameritrade will tabulate votes cast on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement at the TD Ameritrade special meeting pursuant to the voting condition set forth in the merger agreement as well as the 662/3% voting standard contemplated by Section 203. TD Ameritrade will publicly announce the voting results following the completion of the TD Ameritrade special meeting based on the voting condition set forth in the merger agreement as well as the Section 203 voting standard.

The joint proxy statement/prospectus is hereby amended and supplemented on page 95 by adding the following after the first full paragraph under the section titled ""-Required Vote"":

On May 12, 2020, a putative class action complaint challenging the merger was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint is captioned Hawkes v. Bettino et al., case number 2020-0306-PAF, and names as Defendants each member of the TD Ameritrade board of directors who was on the TD Ameritrade board of directors when the merger agreement was approved, TD Bank and Schwab. Among other things, the complaint asserts a claim against such directors alleging that the merger violates Section 203. The complaint alleges that, prior to the time that the TD Ameritrade board of directors approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the TD Bank voting agreement, Schwab and TD Bank had reached an ""agreement, arrangement or understanding"" with respect to the voting of TD Bank's shares of TD Ameritrade common stock in favor of the merger in exchange for an amendment and extension of the insured deposit account agreement, thereby causing Schwab to become the ""owner"" of those shares and an ""interested stockholder"" under, and subject to the restriction on business combinations set forth in, Section 203. Under Section 203, if Schwab became an interested stockholder prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval, TD Ameritrade cannot complete a business combination with Schwab, including the merger, for a period of three years following the time that Schwab became an interested stockholder unless the business combination is approved by the TD Ameritrade board of directors and authorized by the TD Ameritrade stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock (other than shares of TD Ameritrade common stock deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203, including the shares owned by TD Bank as alleged in the complaint). The Plaintiff asserts that if Schwab is determined to have become an interested stockholder under Section 203 prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval, the merger will be subject to Section 203's restriction on business combinations because the voting condition set forth in the merger agreement to which the merger is subject would not satisfy the requirement in Section 203(a)(3) that a transaction with an interested stockholder be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder under Section 203. The Plaintiff also alleges various breach of fiduciary duty and other claims against certain Defendants.

The Defendants and TD Ameritrade disagree with the Plaintiff's allegation that Schwab and TD Bank entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding within the meaning of Section 203 prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the TD Bank voting agreement, and the amendment and extension of the insured deposit account agreement, and disagree that Schwab became an interested stockholder under Section 203 prior to the time of such board approval. The Defendants and TD Ameritrade also disagree with the Plaintiff's other allegations and assertions for multiple reasons. The complaint seeks to enjoin the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on and consummation of the merger and seeks an award of damages. The Defendants intend to defend vigorously against the claims alleged in the complaint, including the Section 203 claim, and believe that the claims are without merit.

On May 12, 2020, the Plaintiff also filed (i) a motion seeking to preliminarily enjoin the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on the merger on the grounds that the merger is subject to the business combination restrictions of Section 203, and (ii) a motion for expedited proceedings, which asked the Court to set a preliminary injunction hearing on his Section 203 claim in advance of the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on the merger.

TD Ameritrade will publicly announce the voting results following the completion of the TD Ameritrade special meeting based on the voting condition set forth in the merger agreement as well as the Section 203 voting standard.

The joint proxy statement/prospectus is hereby amended and supplemented on page 79 by adding the following after the second full paragraph under the section titled ""Risk Factors-Lawsuits have been filed against Schwab, TD Ameritrade and the TD Ameritrade board of directors and other lawsuits may be filed against Schwab, TD Ameritrade and /or their respective boards of directors challenging the merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed."":

On May 12, 2020, a putative class action complaint challenging the merger was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint is captioned Hawkes v. Bettino et al., case number 2020-0306-PAF, and names as Defendants each member of the TD Ameritrade board of directors who was on the TD Ameritrade board of directors when the merger agreement was approved, TD Bank and Schwab. Among other things, the complaint asserts a claim against such directors alleging that the merger violates Section 203. The complaint alleges that, prior to the time that the TD Ameritrade board of directors approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the TD Bank voting agreement, Schwab and TD Bank had reached an ""agreement, arrangement or understanding"" with respect to the voting of TD Bank's shares of TD Ameritrade common stock in favor of the merger in exchange for an amendment and extension of the insured deposit account agreement, thereby causing Schwab to become the ""owner"" of those shares and an ""interested stockholder"" under, and subject to the restriction on business combinations set forth in, Section 203. The Plaintiff also alleges various breach of fiduciary duty and other claims against certain Defendants. The Defendants and TD Ameritrade dispute the claims asserted in the complaint and believe they are without merit.

If the Court were to find that Schwab became an interested stockholder prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval within the meaning of Section 203, then under Section 203 the merger-even if all other closing conditions in the merger agreement were satisfied-could not be completed for a three year period unless it was authorized by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock not deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203.

If Section 203 applies to the merger and the merger is not authorized in accordance with the statute by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock not deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203 (including, as alleged in the complaint, treating the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock owned by TD Bank and its affiliates as ""owned"" by Schwab for this purpose) at the TD Ameritrade special meeting, under Section 203, the merger could not be completed. Were that to occur, TD Ameritrade and Schwab would remain bound by the merger agreement and could determine to re-solicit TD Ameritrade stockholder authorization and approval of the merger agreement by a vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock not deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203, or the merger agreement could be terminated under certain circumstances, including in certain circumstances if the merger has not been completed on or prior to the November 24, 2020 initial end date. Notwithstanding the Defendants' and TD Ameritrade's disagreement with the claims asserted in the complaint and their belief that Section 203 does not apply to the merger, by way of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, TD Ameritrade is asking stockholders to approve the merger by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock not deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203 (including, as alleged in the complaint, treating the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock owned by TD Bank and its affiliates as ""owned"" by Schwab for this purpose), which the Plaintiff has agreed would moot Plaintiff's Section 203 claim.

Section 203 defines a ""business combination"" to include, among other transactions, any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested stockholder. Section 203 defines an ""interested stockholder"" to include any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation. Section 203 defines ""owner"" to include a person that individually or with or through any of its affiliates or associates: beneficially owns such stock, directly or indirectly; has the right to acquire such stock (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise (subject to certain exceptions) or has the right to vote such stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (subject to certain exceptions); or has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (subject to certain exceptions) or disposing of such stock with any other person that beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such stock.

The joint proxy statement/prospectus is hereby amended and supplemented on page 161 by adding the following after the second paragraph under the section titled ""-Litigation Relating to the Merger"":

On May 12, 2020, a putative class action complaint challenging the merger was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint is captioned Hawkes v. Bettino et al., case number 2020-0306-PAF, and names as Defendants each member of the TD Ameritrade board of directors who was on the TD Ameritrade board of directors when the merger agreement was approved, TD Bank and Schwab. Among other things, the complaint asserts a claim against such directors alleging that the merger violates Section 203 and that the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus fails to disclose that the merger does not comply with Section 203, which the complaint claims is a material omission. The complaint alleges that, prior to the time that the TD Ameritrade board of directors approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the TD Bank voting agreement, Schwab and TD Bank had reached an ""agreement, arrangement or understanding"" with respect to the voting of TD Bank's shares of TD Ameritrade common stock in favor of the merger in exchange for an amendment and extension of the insured deposit account agreement, thereby causing Schwab to become the ""owner"" of those shares and an ""interested stockholder"" under, and subject to the restriction on business combinations set forth in, Section 203. Under Section 203, if Schwab became an interested stockholder prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval, TD Ameritrade cannot complete a business combination with Schwab, including the merger, for a period of three years following the time that Schwab became an interested stockholder unless the business combination is approved by the TD Ameritrade board of directors and authorized by the TD Ameritrade stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding TD Ameritrade common stock (other than shares of TD Ameritrade common stock deemed owned by Schwab under Section 203, including the shares owned by TD Bank as alleged in the complaint).

The Defendants and TD Ameritrade disagree with the Plaintiff's allegation that Schwab and TD Bank entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding within the meaning of Section 203 prior to the TD Ameritrade board approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the TD Bank voting agreement, and the amendment and extension of the insured deposit account agreement, and disagree that Schwab became an interested stockholder under Section 203 prior to the time of such board approval. The Defendants and TD Ameritrade also disagree with the Plaintiff's other allegations and assertions for multiple reasons. The complaint also alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty against members of the TD Ameritrade board of directors who the Plaintiff alleges are affiliated with TD Bank and against TD Bank as TD Ameritrade's alleged controlling stockholder, relating to the insured deposit account agreement entered into between Schwab and TD Bank. The complaint further alleges a claim against Schwab for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint seeks to enjoin the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on and consummation of the merger and seeks an award of damages. The Defendants intend to defend vigorously against the claims alleged in the complaint and believe that the claims are without merit.

On May 12, 2020, the Plaintiff also filed (i) a motion seeking to preliminarily enjoin the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on the merger on the grounds that the merger is subject to the business combination restrictions of Section 203, and (ii) a motion for expedited proceedings, which asked the Court to set a preliminary injunction hearing on his Section 203 claim in advance of the TD Ameritrade stockholder vote on the merger. On May 15, 2020, the Court held a hearing on the Plaintiff's motion for expedited proceedings. The Court granted the Plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery, but declined to hold any injunction hearing on the Plaintiff's Section 203 claim prior to the TD Ameritrade special meeting scheduled for June 4, 2020. The Court has indicated that it will schedule a merits hearing on the Plaintiff's Section 203 claim for July or August 2020.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed, on February 25, 2020, one purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative derivative and class action lawsuit against the Company, the members of the Company's board of directors, Wellesley Bank, Cambridge and Cambridge Trust Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, on behalf of himself and similarly situated Wellesley stockholders, and derivatively on behalf of the Company, captioned Parshall v. Fontaine et al., Case No. 24-C-20-001127 (the ""Merger Litigation""). The plaintiff generally alleged, among other things, that the Company's board of directors breached its fiduciary obligations by approving the Merger Agreement and that the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020 and first mailed to the Company's stockholders on February 6, 2020 contained materially incomplete disclosures about the merger. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, rescission of the merger or rescissory damages, other unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

On March 6, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K making additional disclosures to supplement the disclosures in the allegedly misleading proxy statement as set forth in the complaint. The plaintiff agreed that the Form 8-K mooted his disclosure claims, and accordingly agreed to voluntarily dismiss the complaint.

The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Periodically, there may be various claims and lawsuits against us, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which we hold security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other issues incident to our business. The Company's management believes that such routine legal proceedings, in the aggregate, are immaterial to the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On February 25, 2020, one purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative derivative and class action lawsuit against Wellesley, the members of the Company's board of directors, Wellesley Bank, Cambridge Bancorp (""Cambridge"") and Cambridge Trust Company in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, on behalf of himself and similarly situated Wellesley stockholders, and derivatively on behalf of the Company, captioned Parshall v. Fontaine et al., Case No. 24-C-20-001127 (the ""Merger Litigation""). The plaintiff generally alleged that the Company's board of directors breached its fiduciary obligations by approving the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 5, 2019, by and among the Company, Cambridge, Cambridge Trust Company and Wellesley Bank, which provides for, among other things, the merger of the Company with and into Cambridge. The plaintiff further alleged inadequate merger consideration. Lastly, the plaintiff alleged that the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020 and first mailed to the Company's stockholders on February 6, 2020 contained materially incomplete disclosures about the merger. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, rescission of the merger or rescissory damages, other unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

Item 8.01 | Other Events.

On February 25, 2020, one purported stockholder of Wellesley Bancorp, Inc.

Fontaine et al., Case No. 24-C-20-001127 (the ""Merger Litigation""). The plaintiff generally alleges that the Wellesley board of directors breached its fiduciary obligations by approving the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 5, 2019, by and among Wellesley, Cambridge, Cambridge Trust Company and Wellesley Bank, which provides for, among other things, the merger of Wellesley with and into Cambridge. The plaintiff further alleges inadequate merger consideration. Lastly, the plaintiff alleges that the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on February 4, 2020 and first mailed to Wellesley stockholders on February 6, 2020 contained materially incomplete disclosures about the merger. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, rescission of the merger or rescissory damages, other unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

On March 5, 2020, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, Wellesley and Cambridge have agreed to make additional disclosures to supplement the disclosures contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the ""Additional Disclosures""). The Additional Disclosures are set forth below and should be read in conjunction with the joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The Additional Disclosures moot plaintiff's disclosure claims asserted in the Merger Litigation and, as a result, the plaintiff has agreed to dismiss the Merger Litigation with prejudice as to his individual claims and without prejudice to the claims of the putative members of the class.

On January 28, 2020, Elaine Wang, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Dermira and the individual members of the Dermira Board, captioned Wang v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:20-cv-00634-SK (the ""Wang Complaint""). The Wang Complaint asserts that the defendants named therein violated sections 14(e), 14(d) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting material information from the Schedule14D-9. The Wang Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions, revisions to the Schedule14D-9 and monetary damages.

On January 31, 2020, Changxia Yuan, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Dermira and the individual members of the Dermira Board, captioned Yuan v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00848-LAP (the ""Yuan Complaint""). The Yuan Complaint asserts that the defendants named therein violated sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting material information from the Schedule14D-9. The Yuan Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions and monetary damages.

On February 6, 2020, Frederick Kahn, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo against Dermira and the individual members of the Dermira Board, captioned Kahn v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 20-CIV-0811 (the ""Kahn Complaint""). The Kahn Complaint asserts that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly entering into the Transactions through a flawed and unfair sales process, failing to maximize the value of Dermira to its stockholders and filing a materially deficient Schedule 14D-9. The Kahn Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions and monetary damages.

Lilly believes that the claims asserted in the pending actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Surakanti Complaint and the Wang Complaint ), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Thompson Complaint), the Southern District of New York (the Schneider Complaint and the Yuan Complaint), and the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County (the Kahn Complaint) (referred to collectively as the ""Actions"") are without merit and denies the allegations in each of those Actions. However, in order to alleviate the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Dermira has provided certain additional disclosures in its Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 14D-9 (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Counsel for plaintiffs in each of the Actions have confirmed that the Supplemental Disclosures will moot their claims. The Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with this Schedule TO, which should be read in its entirety. The Supplemental Disclosures should not be regarded as an indication that any of Dermira, Lilly, Purchaser or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any recipient of this information, considered or now considers the information contained in the Supplemental Disclosures to be material. Rather, Lilly believes that all material information was disclosed, and denies that any additional disclosures are or were required under any applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation. To the extent that the information in the Supplemental Disclosures differ from information contained in this Schedule TO, the information in the Supplemental Disclosures supersede such information contained in this Schedule TO.

Additional lawsuits may be filed against Dermira, the Dermira Board, Lilly, and Purchaser in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Schedule TO and the Schedule14D-9.""

On January 28, 2020, Elaine Wang, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Dermira and the individual members of the Board, captioned Wang v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 3:20-cv-00634-SK (the ""Wang Complaint""). The Wang Complaint asserts that the defendants named therein violated sections 14(e), 14(d) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting material information from the Schedule14D-9. The Wang Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions, revisions to the Schedule14D-9 and monetary damages.

On January 31, 2020, Changxia Yuan, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Dermira and the individual members of the Board, captioned Yuan v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00848-LAP (the ""Yuan Complaint""). The Yuan Complaint asserts that the defendants named therein violated sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting material information from the Schedule14D-9. The Yuan Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions and monetary damages.

On February 6, 2020, Frederick Kahn, a purported stockholder of Dermira, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo against Dermira and the individual members of the Board, captioned Kahn v. Dermira, Inc., et. al., Case No. 20-CIV-0811 (the ""Kahn Complaint""). The Kahn Complaint asserts that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly entering into the Transactions through a flawed and unfair sales process, failing to maximize the value of Dermira to its stockholders and filing a materially deficient Schedule 14D-9. The Kahn Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Transactions and monetary damages.

Additional lawsuits may be filed against Dermira, the Board, Lilly, and Purchaser in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Schedule TO and the Schedule14D-9.

Dermira believes that the claims asserted in the pending actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Surakanti Complaint and the Wang Complaint ), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Thompson Complaint), the Southern District of New York (the Schneider Complaint and the Yuan Complaint), and the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County (the Kahn Complaint) (referred to collectively as the ""Actions"") are without merit and denies the allegations in each of those Actions. However, in order to alleviate the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Dermira has provided certain additional disclosures in this Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 14D-9 (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Counsel for plaintiffs in each of the Actions have confirmed that the Supplemental Disclosures will moot their claims. The Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with this Schedule 14D-9, which should be read in its entirety. The Supplemental Disclosures should not be regarded as an indication that any of Dermira, Lilly, Purchaser or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any recipient of this information, considered or now considers the information contained in the Supplemental Disclosures to be material. Rather, Dermira believes that this Schedule 14D-9 disclosed all material information, and denies that any additional disclosures are or were required under any applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation. To the extent that the information in the Supplemental Disclosures differ from information contained in this Schedule 14D-9, the information in the Supplemental Disclosures supersede such information contained in this Schedule 14D-9.

Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by deleting the paragraph under the heading ""Legal Proceedings"" and replacing it with the following paragraphs:

""On February 3, 2020, John Thompson filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court of Delaware in an action styled Thompson v. Primo Water Corporation et al., 1:20-cv-00172-UNA. Mr. Thompson alleges that he is a stockholder of Primo and purports to bring the lawsuit on behalf of himself and a putative class defined as all similarly-situated Company stockholders. The complaint names as defendants the Company, all of the members of the Company Board, Cott, Purchaser, and the other parties to the merger agreement. The complaint purports to state claims for violations of Sections 14(e), 14(d) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff in this action generally alleges that the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company on January 29, 2020 omits material information with respect to the proposed transaction which renders the Schedule 14D-9 false and misleading. More specifically, the complaint alleges that the Schedule 14D-9 contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning the financial projections prepared by the Company and Cott, and the financial analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisor. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, an injunction preventing the consummation of the proposed transaction, a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(e), 14(d) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, rescission of the proposed transaction or rescissory damages in the event it is consummated, and the award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

On February 4, 2020, Brandon Flink filed a putative class action lawsuit in the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, North Carolina, in an action styled Flink v. Primo Water Corporation, et al., 20-cvs-724. Mr. Flink alleges that he is a stockholder of Primo and purports to bring the lawsuit on behalf of himself and a putative class of all similarly-situated Company stockholders. The complaint names as defendants the Company, all of the members of the Company Board, Cott, Purchaser, and the other parties to the merger agreement. The complaint alleges that the defendants have violated applicable law by directly breaching and/or aiding breaches of fiduciary duties of loyalty and due care owed to plaintiff and the purported class. Among other things, the complaint alleges that the Company Board agreed to preclusive deal protection devices and engaged in an insufficient sales process. The complaint further alleges that the proposed transaction may be tainted by potential conflicts of interest of the directors and Company executives. The complaint also challenges the disclosures in the Schedule 14D-9 of the Company filed on January 29, 2020 as materially deficient because of the purported failure to provide information concerning, among other things, (a) the sales process leading up to the proposed transaction, (b) certain of the Company's and Cott's financial projections, and (c) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analysis prepared by the Company's financial advisor. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, an injunction preventing the consummation of the proposed transaction, damages, and attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company believes that the allegations in each of these complaints are without merit.""

2020-04-29 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/784011/000119312520125268/d899942d8k.htm]:
As previously disclosed, on January 14, 2020, Pope Resources, a Delaware limited partnership (""Pope"" or the ""Company""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of April 1, 2020 (as amended and as may be further amended from time to time, the ""Merger Agreement"") by and among Rayonier Inc. (""Rayonier""), Rayonier, L.P., (""Opco""), Rayonier Operating Company LLC (""ROC""), Rayonier Operating Company Holdings, LLC, Pacific GP Merger Sub I, LLC (""Merger Sub 1""), Pacific GP Merger Sub II, LLC (""Merger Sub 2""), Pacific LP Merger Sub III, LLC (""Merger Sub 3""), Pope, Pope MGP, Inc. (""MGP"") and Pope EGP, Inc (""EGP""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Pope, with Pope surviving such merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Opco (such transaction, the ""Merger"").

In connection with the proposed Merger, on April 6, 2020 Rayonier, Opco and Pope filed a proxy statement/prospectus (the ""Proxy Statement/Prospectus""), which Proxy Statement/Prospectus was mailed on or about April 6, 2020 to Pope unitholders of record as of March 30, 2020.

Four lawsuits challenging disclosures made in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus have been filed as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. On March 19, 2020, a purported Pope unitholder filed a lawsuit against Pope and its board of directors alleging that, among other things, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained materially incomplete and misleading information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed Merger, an award of rescissory damages and plaintiffs' costs, including attorneys' fees. This lawsuit is captioned Stein v. Pope Resources, et al., No. 1:20-CV-00387, and is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On March 26, 2020, a purported Pope unitholder filed a putative class action purportedly on behalf of the unitholders of Pope against Pope, its board of directors, Rayonier, ROC, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, MGP and EGP alleging that, among other things, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained materially incomplete and misleading information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed Merger, an award of rescissory damages and plaintiffs' costs, including attorneys' fees. This lawsuit is captioned Thompson v. Pope Resources, et al., No. 1:20-CV-00432, and is also pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On April 14, 2020, a purported Pope unitholder filed a putative class action purportedly on behalf of the unitholders of Pope against Pope, its board of directors and Rayonier alleging, among other things, that members of the Pope board of directors breached their duty of loyalty under the Pope limited partnership agreement and Delaware law in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, that Rayonier aided and abetted such breach and that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus misrepresents or omits material information. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed Merger, an award of compensatory and/or rescissory damages and plaintiffs' costs, including attorneys' fees. This lawsuit is captioned Laidlaw v. Pope Resources, et al., No. 20-2-00755-18, and is pending in the Superior Court of the State of Washington in and for Kitsap County. On April 17, 2020, another purported Pope unitholder filed a lawsuit against Pope and its board of directors alleging that, among other things, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained false and misleading information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed Merger, an award of rescissory damages and plaintiff's costs, including attorneys' fees. This lawsuit is captioned Arzonetti v. Pope Resources, et al., No. 1:20-cv-03102, and is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Pope believes that the claims asserted in the complaints are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk of the lawsuits delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the lawsuits, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Pope is voluntarily supplementing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Each of the plaintiffs has agreed that, following the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, they will dismiss their respective actions in their entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs.

These additional disclosures in this Current Report on Form 8-K supplement the disclosures contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which in turn should be read in its entirety. To the extent that information in this Current Report on Form 8-K differs from or updates information contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall supersede or supplement the information in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. In addition, these supplemental disclosures will not affect the merger consideration to be received by Pope unitholders in connection with the Merger or the timing of the special meeting of Pope unitholders scheduled for May 5, 2020, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, at the offices of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, 920 Fifth Avenue Suite 3300, Seattle, Washington 98104, as described further in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The Anderson Action also names Parent and Merger Subsidiary as defendants.

On January 25, 2021, a substantially similar complaint was filed against NIC and the members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Walker v. Navistar International Corporation, et al., Case No. 21-cv-00398 (E.D.N.Y.) (""Walker""). On February 19, 2021, a substantially similar complaint was filed against NIC and the members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned Baker v. Navistar International Corporation, et al., Case No. 21-cv-00762 (E.D.Pa.) (""Baker""). The complaints referenced above (collectively, the ""Complaints"") allege that the Proxy Statement (defined below) and preliminary versions of the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020 and January 21, 2021, were materially incomplete and therefore misleading in certain aspects.

On January 20, 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed against NIC, the Board, Parent and Merger Sub in the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, Chancery Division, captioned Drulias v. Clarke, et al., Case No. 2021-CH-000022 (Ill. DuPage Cty. Cir. Ct.) (""Drulias"" and, collectively with Stein, LaFrance, Anderson, Grinberger, Walker, Sheridan, Arnold, Williams and Baker, the ""Complaints""). Drulias alleges breaches of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith, loyalty, fair dealing and full disclosure under Delaware law by NIC and the members of the Board, and alleges that Parent and TRATON US, Inc. aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.

On January 29, 2021, NIC filed the definitive proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger (the ""Proxy Statement"").

NIC believes the allegations in the Complaints are without merit. However, on February 22, 2021, NIC reached a settlement or a settlement in principle with respect to each of the Complaints. In connection with the settlements and settlements in principle, NIC voluntarily supplemented the Proxy Statement with the disclosures set forth in the Form 8-K dated and filed on February 23, 2021 in exchange for a release of all of the claims alleged in the Complaints. The aggregate amount of such settlements are immaterial, and we expect that the aggregate amount of the definitive settlements for those Complaints that NIC has reached a settlement in principle will also be immaterial. On February 24, 2021, Arnold was dismissed. On February 26, 2021, Stein, LaFrance, Williams, Baker and Drulias were dismissed. On March 2, 2021, Anderson, Grinberger and Sheridan were dismissed. On March 3, 2021, Walker was dismissed.

Supplemental Disclosures to Definitive Proxy Statement

As previously disclosed, on November 7, 2020, Navistar International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""Company"" or ""Navistar""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with TRATON SE, a Societas Europaea (""Parent"" or ""TRATON""), and Dusk Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent.

On January 20, 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company, the members of the Board, Parent and TRATON US, Inc. in the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, Chancery Division, captioned Drulias v.

Drulias alleges breaches of the fiduciary duties of due care, good faith, loyalty, fair dealing and full disclosure under Delaware law by the Company and the members of the Board, and alleges that Parent and TRATON US, Inc. aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. On January 29, 2021, the Company filed the definitive proxy statement relating to the Merger (the ""Proxy Statement"").

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot the purported stockholders' disclosure and breach of fiduciary duty claims in the Complaints, to avoid nuisance, cost and distraction, and to preclude any efforts to delay the closing of the Merger, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required or that any fiduciary duty was or is breached. The Company believes the Complaints are without merit.

This supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement.

There can be no certainty that the regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger will be obtained within the period of time contemplated by the Merger Agreement or that any such approvals would not be conditioned upon actions that are not required to be taken by the Company or Parent under the Merger Agreement, or that a regulatory challenge to the Merger will not be made.

Item 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

As previously announced, on November 14, 2020, Taubman Centers, Inc., a Michigan corporation (""TCO"" or the ""Company""), The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Taubman Operating Partnership"" and, together with TCO, the ""Taubman Parties""), Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Simon""), Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Simon Operating Partnership""), Silver Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Simon Operating Partnership (""Merger Sub 1""), and Silver Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub 1 (""Merger Sub 2"" and, together with Simon, the Simon Operating Partnership and Merger Sub 1, the ""Simon Parties""), entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""merger agreement""), amending and restating the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Taubman Parties and the Simon Parties, dated February 9, 2020 (the ""original merger agreement""). Pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub 2 will be merged with and into the Taubman Operating Partnership (the ""Partnership Merger"") and TCO will be merged with and into Merger Sub 1 (the ""REIT Merger"" and, together with the Partnership Merger, the ""Mergers""). In connection with the merger agreement, on December 4, 2020, TCO filed a definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"").

In connection with the original merger agreement and/or the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, two purported class action complaints are presently pending on behalf of TCO shareholders against the Taubman Parties and Simon Parties (in the case of one of the complaints) and members of TCO's board of directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the Circuit Court for the 6th Judicial Circuit, Oakland County, of the State of Michigan. The two complaints are captioned as follows: Post v. Taubman Centers, Inc., et al., No. 1:20-cv-00685-UNA (D. Del.) (the ""Post Action"") and Elstein v. Taubman Centers, Inc., et al., No. 2020-185008-CB (Oakland County Cir. Ct.) (the ""Elstein Action"" and, together with the Post Action, the ""Shareholder Actions""). The Post Action alleges that the defendants named therein violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or were legally responsible for such alleged violations, because the proxy statement filed by TCO on May 29, 2020 allegedly omits or misstates certain material information. The Elstein Action alleges that the defendants named therein breached their fiduciary duties to the putative class and TCO under Michigan law, including their duty to disclose all material facts in the Proxy Statement. The Elstein action additionally asserts derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty, including breach of a fiduciary obligation to cause TCO to completely disclose all material facts in the Proxy Statement so that plaintiff and TCO's other public shareholders can make an informed decision whether to vote their shares in favor of the merger. A copy of the complaint in the Elstein action (the ""Elstein Complaint"") is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Shareholder Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Mergers, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. Similar, earlier shareholder actions filed in connection with the original merger agreement were voluntarily dismissed.

TCO believes that no supplemental disclosures are required under applicable law. However, TCO is making certain disclosures below that supplement and revise those contained in the Proxy Statement. TCO denies that any of the defendants have committed or assisted others in committing any violations of law. Nothing in these supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the supplemental disclosures set forth herein.

The following supplemental disclosures should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. To the extent that information herein differs from or updates information contained in the Proxy Statement, the information contained herein supersedes the information contained in the Proxy Statement. Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. For clarity, new text within restated paragraphs from the Proxy Statement are highlighted with bold, underlined text.

","To determine whether the case discussed in the provided content is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""two purported class action complaints"" in the following sentence:

""In connection with the original merger agreement and/or the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, two purported class action complaints are presently pending on behalf of TCO shareholders against the Taubman Parties and Simon Parties (in the case of one of the complaints) and members of TCO's board of directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the Circuit Court for the 6th Judicial Circuit, Oakland County, of the State of Michigan.""

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The keyword ""class action"" indeed states that the case of interest is a class action. Specifically, the Elstein Action (2020-185008-CB) is mentioned as one of the two purported class action complaints.

Since the case is confirmed to be a class action by this keyword search, I will output ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" and the sentence containing ""class action"" as ""quote"".

Here is the JSON object:

}
```",NOBLAW50552395,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Analyze the LLM’s Search and Confirmation of ""Class Action"" Mentions**

Upon reviewing the LLM response, it appropriately starts by searching for the term ""class action."" It identifies a sentence in the filing excerpts that mentions ""two purported class action complaints."" This sentence includes the Elstein Action as one of the cases.

**Step 2: Check if the LLM Correctly Interpreted and Cited the Information**

The LLM correctly cited this portion: 

""In connection with the original merger agreement and/or the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, two purported class action complaints are presently pending on behalf of TCO shareholders against the Taubman Parties and Simon Parties (in the case of one of the complaints) and members of TCO's board of directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the Circuit Court for the 6th Judicial Circuit, Oakland County, of the State of Michigan.""

This sentence indeed lists the Elstein Action as one of the purported class actions.

**Step 3: Confirm LLM’s Classification of the Elstein Action**

The LLM concludes ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" based on the explicit mention of the Elstein Action as part of the two purported class actions. This is consistent with the task instructions, which asked to confirm explicit mentions or language indicating class actions.

**Step 4: Summarize the Findings**

Since the excerpts explicitly describe the Elstein Action as a ""purported class action"" involving TCO shareholders, the LLM's conclusion and reasoning are both accurate and follow the task instructions precisely.

**Final Analysis:**

The LLM correctly interpreted the information in the excerpts without making any contradictory statements, misinterpretations, or task instruction deviations.

Item 8 ""Additional Information"" of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and restated by deleting the sentence under the section entitled ""Legal Proceedings"" on page 41 and replacing it with the following paragraphs:

""On March 16, 17 and 20, 2020, three complaints were filed in federal courts by purported stockholders of the Company regarding the Merger. The first complaint, filed on an individual basis by the plaintiff, is captioned Stephen Bushansky v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., No. 3:20-cv-01853 (N.D. Cal. filed Mar. 16, 2020). The second complaint, filed as a putative class action, is captioned Joseph Post v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., No. 1:20-cv-00377 (D. Del. filed Mar. 17, 2020). The third complaint, filed on an individual basis by the plaintiff, is captioned Jason Augustine v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., No. 5:20-cv-01978 (N.D. Cal. filed Mar. 20, 2020) (collectively, the ""Federal Complaints""). The Federal Complaints name as defendants the Company and each member of the Company Board. The Post complaint additionally names as defendants Gilead and Purchaser. The Federal Complaints allege violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act against all defendants, and assert violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. The Post complaint additionally alleges a violation of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act against all defendants and a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Gilead and Purchaser. The plaintiffs contend that the Schedule 14D-9 omitted or misrepresented material information regarding the Merger. The Federal Complaints seek (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions; (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event the Transactions are consummated; and (iii) an award of plaintiff's expenses and attorneys' fees. The Post complaint additionally seeks dissemination of a recommendation statement that discloses certain information requested by that plaintiff. The Company and the individual defendants believe the claims asserted in the Federal Complaints are without merit.

On March 20, 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed in state court by a purported stockholder of the Company regarding the Merger, captioned Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., case number pending (Cal. Super. Ct., San Mateo, filed Mar. 20, 2020). The Hawkins complaint names as defendants the Company and certain members of the Company Board. The Hawkins complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty claims against the individual defendants and an aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against the Company. The plaintiff contends that the Transactions are unfair and undervalue the Company, and that the Schedule 14D-9 omitted or misrepresented material information regarding the Merger. The Hawkins complaint seeks (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions; (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event the Transactions are consummated; (iii) injunctive relief directing the individual defendants to commence a sale process; (iv) an accounting of purported damages; and (v) an award of plaintiff's expenses and attorneys' fees, and the Augustine complaint seeks and accounting of purported damages. The Company and the individual defendants believe the claims asserted in the Hawkins complaint are without merit.

Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Company Board, Gilead and/or Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, the Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9.""

","To determine whether the target case, Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., is a class action, I will follow the steps outlined in the thinking instruction.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""class action"" in the following sentence: ""On March 20, 2020, a complaint was filed in state court by a purported stockholder of the Company regarding the Merger. The complaint, filed as a putative class action, is captioned Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., case number pending (Cal. Super. Ct., San Mateo, filed Mar. 20, 2020).""

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The keyword ""class action"" is indeed mentioned in the context of the target case, Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al. The phrase ""putative class action"" suggests that the case is intended to be a class action, but the court has not yet certified it as such.

Since the keyword search provides sufficient evidence, I will output ""Likely"" for ""is_class_action"" and the sentence containing ""class action"" as ""quote"".

Here is the JSON object:

}
```",NOBLAW28195150,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's break down whether the LLM hallucinated in its response, based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts.

Step 1: Search for the Keyword ""Class Action""
The filing excerpts mention the target case, ""Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al.,"" as a ""putative class action,"" which is found in the sentence: 
""On March 20, 2020, a complaint was filed in state court by a purported stockholder of the Company regarding the Merger. The complaint, filed as a putative class action, is captioned Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al., case number pending (Cal. Super. Ct., San Mateo, filed Mar. 20, 2020).""
The LLM correctly identifies this mention.

Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention
The LLM accurately confirms that the mention of ""putative class action"" is indeed in the context of the target case, Darryl Hawkins v. Forty Seven, Inc., et al. The term ""putative class action"" indicates the case is intended to be a class action, although it may not yet be certified by the court as such.

Step 3: Assessment
The determination that the case is ""Likely"" a class action aligns with the explanation that a ""putative class action"" suggests intent for class action status but does not confirm certification by the court. 

Conclusion
The LLM's conclusion to label the case as ""Likely"" for ""is_class_action"" and provide the correct sentence as a quote aligns with the task instructions. The response does not misinterpret, contradict, or diverge from the given instructions.

The complaints in the preceding paragraph allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits material information or contains misleading disclosures and that, as a result, (i) all of the defendants violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act (except for the Goodman Complaint), (ii) all of the defendants violated Section 14(d)(4) of the Exchange Act (except for the Leon and Davison Complaints) and (iii) all of Stemline's directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Johnston Complaint alleges that each of the directors violated his fiduciary duty of candor and disclosure.

On May 20, 2020, a purported stockholder of Stemline filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Stemline, Stemline's directors, Parent and Purchaser, captioned Adam Franchi v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-00683 (the ""Franchi Complaint""). The Franchi Complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated Sections 14(e) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act and Parent and each of Stemline's directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

On May 26, 2020, a purported stockholder of Stemline filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, against Stemline and its directors, captioned Ellen Levinson v. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., et al. (the ""Levinson Complaint""). The Levinson Complaint alleges that Stemline's directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith by, among other things, causing Stemline to enter into the Transactions as a result of an inadequate sales process, agreeing to preclusive deal mechanisms and filing a materially misleading and incomplete Schedule 14D-9. The Levinson Complaint also alleges that Stemline aided and abetted the purported breach of fiduciary duties.

Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, (i) injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) rescissory damages or rescission in the event that the Transactions have already been consummated (except for the Johnston Complaint), (iii) damages (except for the Wolfe, Jones and Franchi Complaints) and (iv) plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees. The defendants believe the claims asserted in each of the complaints are without merit.

Del. filed September 1, 2020). A third complaint was filed on an individual basis by the plaintiff on September 4, 2020, and is captioned Stephen Bushansky v.

The Wang, Curtis and Hawkins complaints allege violations of Section 14(d) and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act against all Principia Defendants, and assert violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual Principia Defendants. The Curtis complaint additionally alleges violations of Section 14(d) and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act against the Sanofi Defendants and a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Sanofi. The Bushansky and Wolfson complaints each allege a violation of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act against the Principia Defendants and a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual Principia Defendants. The State Court Complaint alleges claims of breaches of fiduciary duties against each member of the Principia Board and a claim of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against Principia.

2. **Confirm Class Action Mention**: Realizing that the ""class action"" reference is not linked to the target case, the LLM proceeds to the next step without making any assumptions or conclusions based on this irrelevant mention.

3. **Search for Other Keywords**: The LLM identifies specific language in the filing excerpts for the target case, where it explicitly states that the lawsuit was ""filed by the plaintiff on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated."" This language strongly suggests that the target case, Harrison v. Principia Biopharma Inc., is intended to represent a class, aligning with the instructions' criteria for determining a likelihood of a class action.

4. **Conclusion**: The LLM concludes that the case is ""Likely"" a class action based on the key language found in the provided excerpts. The language used meets the standards set in the instructions for suggesting that the case involves a representation of similarly situated individuals: ""on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.""

The LLM followed the instructions systematically and based the classification on explicit language in the excerpts. The assessment that the Harrison case is ""Likely"" a class action due to the presence of this language is correct.

As previously disclosed, on December 13, 2020, TCF Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation (""TCF""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the ""merger agreement"") with Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation (""Huntington""). The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, TCF will merge with and into Huntington (the ""merger""), with Huntington as the surviving entity in the merger. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of TCF and Huntington.

In connection with the proposed merger, Huntington filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement on Form S-4 containing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, as amended, and each of TCF and Huntington filed a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC dated February 17, 2021 (the ""joint proxy statement/prospectus""), which TCF and Huntington first mailed to their respective shareholders on or about February 17, 2021.

Following the announcement of the merger agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, ten lawsuits challenging the merger have been filed. The first lawsuit, captioned Shiva Stein v. TCF Financial Corporation et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-00273-JKB) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on February 2, 2021. The second lawsuit, captioned Maegon Cassell v. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-00161-MN) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 6, 2021. The third lawsuit, captioned Joe Osterhout v. TCF Financial Corporation et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-00403-SKC) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on February 9, 2021. The fourth lawsuit, captioned Patrick Dionne v. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-01297-VM) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 12, 2021. The fifth lawsuit, captioned Robert Garfield v. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated et al. (Case No. 21CV001045) was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio on February 18, 2021. The sixth lawsuit, captioned James Keffalas v. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-01944) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 5, 2021. The seventh lawsuit, captioned Marcy Curtis v. TCF Financial Corporation et al. (Case No. 2:21-cv-10545-JEL-KGA) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on March 11, 2021. The eighth lawsuit, captioned Frank Gallo v. TCF Financial Corporation et al. (Case No. 5:21-cv-10549-PDB-KGA) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on March 11, 2021. The ninth lawsuit, captioned Stephen Bushansky v. Gary Torgow et al. (Case No.21-003454-CB) was filed in the Wayne County Circuit Court in the State of Michigan on March 12, 2021. The tenth lawsuit, captioned Alex Ciccotelli v. TCF Financial Corporation et al. (Case No. 2:21-cv-01205) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on March 12, 2021. The complaints filed in the lawsuits allege, among other things, that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed merger to be filed with the SEC in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and/or in breach of their fiduciary obligations under state law. We refer to the ten lawsuits collectively as the ""Merger Litigation.""

TCF and Huntington believe that the claims asserted in the Merger Litigation are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Merger Litigation delays or otherwise adversely affects the merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the lawsuits, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, TCF and Huntington have agreed to supplement the joint proxy statement/prospectus as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Plaintiffs in the Merger Litigation have agreed that, following the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, they will each dismiss their complaints as moot. In the Garfield and Bushansky actions, which were filed as a putative class action, such dismissal shall be with prejudice as to the named plaintiff only and without prejudice to all other members of the putative class. TCF, Huntington and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to TCF's shareholders or Huntington's shareholders, as applicable. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, TCF and Huntington specifically deny all allegations in the Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Items 1 through 9 and Item 11.

The disclosure in the Offer to Purchase and Items 1 through 9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO is hereby amended and supplemented by replacing the current paragraphs in Section 16 - ""Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals"" of the Offer to Purchase under the subheading ""Certain Litigation"" with the following paragraphs:

""On December 30, 2020, Lori Karson, a purported stockholder of Prevail, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Lori Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., against Prevail and the Prevail Board (the ""Karson Complaint""). The Karson Complaint asserts a breach of fiduciary duty claim against the individual defendants and an aiding and abetting claim against Prevail in connection with the proposed transaction between Prevail, Purchaser and Lilly. The Karson Complaint alleges, among other things, that (i) defendants engaged in an unfair sales process and agreed to inadequate consideration in connection with the proposed transaction, and (ii) the Schedule 14D-9 filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020 in connection with the proposed transaction is materially misleading. The Karson Complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescind the transaction or award rescissory damages to the extent it is consummated, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

Between January 4, 2021 and January 12, 2021, an additional six complaints were filed in federal district court by purported stockholders of Prevail: (i) Stephen Bushansky v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00040 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Bushansky Complaint""); (ii) Lisa Rosenberg v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00066 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Rosenberg Complaint""); (iii) Marc Waterman v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00085 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Waterman Complaint""); (iv) Judith Latner v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00110 (E.D.N.Y.) (the ""Latner Complaint""); (v) Charles Williams v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00234 (S.D.N.Y.) (the ""Williams Complaint""); and (vi) James Parshall v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-00137 (E.D. Pa.) (the ""Parshall Complaint"") (together, the Bushansky Complaint, the Rosenberg Complaint, the Waterman Complaint, the Latner Complaint, the Williams Complaint, and the Parshall Complaint are referred to as the ""Federal Court Actions""). Each of the Federal Court Actions names Prevail and the Prevail Board as defendants, and the Waterman Complaint and Williams Complaint also name Lilly and Purchaser as defendants. The Rosenberg Complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act, The Bushansky Complaint, Waterman Complaint, the Latner Complaint and the Parshall Complaint assert claims under Sections 14(d), 14(e) and (20)(a) of the Exchange Act, and the Williams Complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Federal Court Actions allege that defendants omitted certain material facts related to the transaction from the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Prevail. The Federal Court Actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the transaction, rescissory damages should the transaction not be enjoined, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

Lilly believes that the claims asserted in the Karson Complaint and the Federal Court Actions (referred to collectively as the ""Actions"") are without merit and denies the allegations in each of those Actions. However, in order to alleviate the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Prevail has provided certain additional disclosures in its Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 14D-9 (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). The Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with this Schedule TO, which should be read in its entirety. The Supplemental Disclosures should not be regarded as an indication that any of Prevail, Lilly, Purchaser or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any recipient of this information, considered or now considers the information contained in the Supplemental Disclosures to be material. Rather, Lilly believes that all material information was disclosed, and denies that any additional disclosures are or were required under any applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation. To the extent that the information in the Supplemental Disclosures differs from information contained in this Schedule TO, the information in the Supplemental Disclosures supersedes such information contained in this Schedule TO.

Adding the following new sub-heading and paragraph at the end of the last paragraph:

""Certain Litigation

On December 30, 2020, Lori Karson, a purported stockholder of Prevail, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Lori Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., against Prevail and the Prevail Board (the ""Karson Complaint""). The Karson Complaint asserts a breach of fiduciary duty claim against the individual defendants and an aiding and abetting claim against Prevail in connection with the proposed transaction between Prevail, Purchaser and Lilly. The Karson Complaint alleges, among other things, that (i) defendants engaged in an unfair sales process and agreed to inadequate consideration in connection with the proposed transaction, and (ii) the Schedule 14D-9 filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020 in connection with the proposed transaction is materially misleading. The Karson Complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the proposed transaction, rescind the transaction or award rescissory damages to the extent it is consummated, and an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.

On January 4, 2021, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned Stephen Bushansky v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00040, against Prevail and the Prevail Board (the ""Bushansky Complaint""). The Bushansky Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 14(d), 14(e), and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by omitting certain material facts related to the transaction from the Schedule 14D-9 filed by Prevail. The Bushansky Complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with, consummating, or closing the transaction, rescissory damages should the transaction not be enjoined, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The outcome of the lawsuits described above cannot be predicted with certainty. However, Prevail believes the claims asserted in the complaints described above are without merit. Additional complaints may be filed against Prevail, the Prevail Board, Lilly and/or Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9. If such additional complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, Lilly and Purchaser will not necessarily announce such additional complaints.""

The following section is added as a new section in Item 8 on p. 45 of the Schedule 14D-9.

(j) | Certain Litigation.

On December 30, 2020, Lori Karson, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and the members of the Company Board in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York, captioned Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Index No. 657378/2020 (the ""Karson Complaint""). The Karson Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendant members of the Company Board breached their fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders in connection with the Transactions by omitting certain material information regarding the Transactions from the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company on December 22, 2020, and by agreeing to enter into the Transactions through an allegedly inadequate process and at an allegedly unfair price. The Karson Complaint further asserts that the Company aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The Karson Complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, rescissory damages or rescission in the event of consummation of the Transactions, declaratory relief related to the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, and certain fees and expenses.

On January 4, 2021, Stephen Bushansky, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company and the members of the Company Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Stephen Bushansky v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00040 (the ""Bushansky Complaint""). The Bushansky Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 14(d), 14(e), and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by omitting certain material facts related to the transaction from the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company on December 22, 2020. The Bushansky Complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Transactions, rescissory damages or rescission in the event of consummation of the Transactions, and certain fees and expenses.

The outcome of the lawsuits described above cannot be predicted with certainty. However, the Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations are without merit. Additional complaints may be filed against the Company, the Company Board, Parent and/or Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9. If such additional complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily announce such additional complaints.

1. **Search for keyword ""class action""**: The document mentions ""putative class action lawsuit"" in the following sentences:

""On December 30, 2020, Lori Karson, a purported stockholder of Prevail, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Lori Karson v.

2. **Confirm class action mention**: The keyword ""class action"" indeed states that the case of interest, Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., is a class action.

Since the case is confirmed to be a class action by this keyword search, I will output ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" and the sentence containing ""class action"" as ""quote"".

}
```",X1Q6O95E7M82,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response methodically, examining each piece of evidence and instruction step by step:

1. **Checking for Explicit Class Action Mention:**  
   The LLM was tasked with identifying whether the case mentioned in the provided context is a class action. The excerpts do contain explicit references to ""putative class action lawsuit,"" which is equivalent to a class action. The sentences extracted by the LLM from the text include:

   - ""On December 30, 2020, Lori Karson, a purported stockholder of Prevail, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Lori Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al., against Prevail and the Prevail Board (the 'Karson Complaint').""

   The term ""putative class action lawsuit"" suggests that the case is intended to be treated as a class action, but it actually indicates the formation of a class later upon court approval. However, in legal documentation, ""putative"" is commonly used to denote initial classification pending certification, and it serves to indicate the plaintiff's intention to seek class certification.

2. **Confirming the Mention Relates to the Target Case:**  
   The target case referenced is ""Karson v. Prevail Therapeutics Inc., et al."" The LLM confirms through its search that this specific case is indeed described as a ""putative class action."" There are multiple mentions within the provided excerpts confirming this relation, and the LLM correctly associates these terms to the target case of interest.

3. **Following the Instructions for Definite Confirmation:**  
   The instructions state that if a case is directly confirmed as a class action through keyword search (""class action"" or analogous terms), then the answer should be ""Yes."" The instruction was accurately followed by the LLM as it found the direct mention of ""putative class action.""

4. **Conclusion and JSON Object Formation:**  
   The LLM makes no contradictions or errors in logic or interpretation based on what it was asked to do. It has accurately assigned a final classification as ""Yes,"" given the explicit mentions present in the excerpts.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

The following disclosures supplement the disclosures contained in the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the ""Proxy Statement""), dated March 5, 2021, which was filed by Change Healthcare Inc. (""Change"" or ""Change Healthcare"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and mailed on or about March 5, 2021 to Change stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2021, in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition of Change by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (""UnitedHealth Group"" and the proposed acquisition, the ""Transaction"").

Following the announcement of the Transaction, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, nine lawsuits challenging the Transaction have been filed. The first lawsuit, a putative class action captioned Krueger v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in Tennessee Chancery Court, Davidson County, on February 24, 2021 and voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on March 17, 2021. The second lawsuit, captioned Brash v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 18, 2021, and amended on March 23, 2021. The third lawsuit, a putative class action captioned Bushansky v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on March 19, 2021. The fourth lawsuit, captioned Wilhelm v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on March 23, 2021. The fifth lawsuit, captioned Schwartz v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on March 23, 2021. The sixth lawsuit, captioned Marin v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on March 24, 2021. The seventh lawsuit, captioned Raagas v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on March 25, 2021. The eighth lawsuit, captioned LR Trust v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on April 6, 2021. The ninth lawsuit, captioned Artis v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on April 7, 2021. The operative complaints filed in the pending lawsuits name Change and Change's board of directors as defendants and allege, among other things, that the Proxy Statement is materially incomplete and misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Change has also received written demands from purported stockholders relating to the Transaction. We refer to the foregoing lawsuits and demands collectively as the ""Merger Actions.""

Change believes that the Merger Actions are without merit and that supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to minimize the risk that the Merger Actions delay or otherwise adversely affect the Transaction, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the lawsuits, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Change has decided to supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K in order to moot certain claims asserted in the Merger Actions. Change and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to Change's stockholders. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, Change specifically denies all allegations in the Merger Actions that any additional disclosure was or is required to supplement the Proxy Statement under applicable law.

While we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to complete the antitrust reviews in a timely manner, there is no certainty that the antitrust reviews will be completed within the period of time contemplated by the Merger Agreement or that the completion of such reviews would not be conditioned upon actions that would be materially adverse to Change or UnitedHealth Group, or that a regulatory challenge to the Merger will not be made.

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 70)

On February 24, 2021, a putative class action, captioned Krueger v. Change Healthcare Inc., et al., 21-0152, was filed in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee against Change and certain of its officers and directors (the ""Individual Defendants""). The complaint contends that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly agreeing to an unfair merger following what plaintiff characterizes as an unfair process. The complaint also alleges that the Individual Defendants failed to disclose certain information in the preliminary proxy statement. In addition, the complaint brings a claim against Change for purportedly aiding and abetting the foregoing alleged breaches. Change has not yet responded to the complaint. While Change believes that the putative class action is without merit and plans to vigorously defend itself against the claims, there can be no assurance that Change will prevail in the lawsuit.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 70)

The exchange of Change Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction to holders of Change Common Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled ""Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"" beginning on page 114. The tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Opinion of Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (""Goldman Sachs"") delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of January 27, 2021 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $29.35 in cash per share of the Company's common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Veritas Capital Fund Management L.L.C., an affiliate of a significant shareholder of the Company and an affiliate of Parent (""Veritas Capital"") and their respective affiliates) of shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 27, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of the Company's common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of $2830 million, $3 million of which became payable at announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Goldman Sachs may receive an additional fee of up to $2 million at the Company's discretion. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Special Factors-Opinions of Perspecta's Financial Advisors-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC"".

The disclosure in the section entitled ""Summary Term Sheet"" under the heading ""Special Factors,"" beginning on page 1 of the Proxy Statement is hereby amended by amending and restating the fourth full paragraph on page 4, and the disclosure in the section entitled ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"" under the heading ""Special Factors"" beginning on page 57 of the Proxy Statement is hereby amended by amending and restating the paragraph under the heading ""Litigation Relating to the Merger"" on page 57 in its entirety, in each case as follows:

TwoSeven complaints have been filed against Perspecta seeking to enjoin and recover damages from the Merger. The first, Wilson v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. A-21-830758-B, was filed against Perspecta, the members of the Board and Veritas Capital Fund Management in the Nevada Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County on March 9, 2021. The purported shareholder class action complaint alleges that Veritas Capital, which the complaint alleges is a controlling shareholder, and the Board breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed Merger by agreeing to inadequate consideration for the proposed Merger, by engaging in a conflicted Merger process, and by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger. The second, Waterman v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 651721/2021, was filed against Perspecta and members of the Board, in the New York Supreme Court in New York County on March 15, 2021. The complaint alleges that the Board breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger, and that Perspecta aided and abetted such breach. Both complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining Perspecta from holding the stockholder meeting to vote on the proposed Merger and taking any steps to consummate the proposed Merger or, in the event the proposed Merger is consummated, an order rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger or any terms thereof, or granting rescissory damages, and to recover an unspecified amount of damages resulting from the alleged violations of fiduciary duties. Five subsequent complaints were filed in U.S. District Courts: Robbins v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01841, was filed on April 5, 2021, in the Eastern District of New York; Debiak v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-03076, was filed on April 9, 2021, in the Southern District of New York; Weiss v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-00649, was filed on April 14, 2021, in the Southern District of California; Parshall v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-00678, was filed on April 16, 2021, in the Southern District of California, and Ciccotelli v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-01863, was filed on April 21, 2021, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Each of these five complaints alleges Perspecta and members of the Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger. Each also alleges the members of the Board violated Section 20 of the Exchange Act by exercising control over person or persons who violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9. All of the complaints filed in U.S. District Courts seek an order enjoining the consummation of the Merger, as well as other relief similar to that sought in the Wilson and Waterman actions. It is possible additional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this proxy statement and consummation of the Merger.

The disclosure in the section entitled ""Background of the Merger"" under the heading ""Special Factors"" beginning on page 13 of the Proxy Statement is hereby amended by inserting a new paragraph after the sixth paragraph on page 18:

Also on December 27, 2020, representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered a relationship disclosure letter to the Board providing information regarding certain of Goldman Sachs' relationships with Veritas Capital, and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, which the Board did not believe would adversely affect its independence.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As previously disclosed in the Proxy Statement, between March 9, 2021 and March 15, 2021, two lawsuits were filed by purported stockholders of Perspecta in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under the captions Wilson v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. A-21-830758-B (Nev. Dist.) and Waterman v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 651721/2021 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). Five additional lawsuits were filed between April 5, 2021 and April 28, 2021: Robbins v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01841 (E.D.N.Y.), Debiak v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-03076 (S.D.N.Y.), Weiss v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-00649 (S.D. Cal.), Parshall v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-00678 (S.D.

The complaints allege, among other things, that the proxy statement disseminated in connection with the Merger omitted material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rendering the proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints name as defendants Perspecta and the Perspecta board of directors. One of the complaints additionally names as a defendant Veritas Capital Fund Management.

Perspecta believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with all applicable law and denies the allegations in the pending actions described above. Perspecta is voluntarily supplementing certain disclosures in the Proxy Statement related to plaintiffs' claims with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal merit, necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein.

The purported shareholder class action complaint alleges that Veritas Capital, which the complaint alleges is a controlling shareholder, and the Board breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed Merger by agreeing to inadequate consideration for the proposed Merger, by engaging in a conflicted Merger process, and by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger.

The complaint alleges that the Board breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger, and that Perspecta aided and abetted such breach. Both complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining Perspecta from holding the stockholder meeting to vote on the proposed Merger and taking any steps to consummate the proposed Merger or, in the event the proposed Merger is consummated, an order rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger or any terms thereof, or granting rescissory damages, and to recover an unspecified amount of damages resulting from the alleged violations of fiduciary duties.

At any time before or after the effective time of the Merger, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of assets of the Company, subject the consummation of the Merger to regulatory conditions or seek other remedies. In addition, state attorneys general and other regulators could take action under the antitrust or other laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the applicable laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Two complaints have been filed against Perspecta seeking to enjoin and recover damages from the Merger. The first, Wilson v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. A-21-830758-B, was filed against Perspecta, the members of the Board and Veritas Capital Fund Management in the Nevada Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County on March 9, 2021. The purported shareholder class action complaint alleges that Veritas Capital, which the complaint alleges is a controlling shareholder, and the Board breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed Merger by agreeing to inadequate consideration for the proposed Merger, by engaging in a conflicted Merger process, and by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger. The second, Waterman v. Perspecta Inc. et al., Case No. 651721/2021, was filed against Perspecta and members of the Board, in the New York Supreme Court in New York County on March 15, 2021. The complaint alleges that the Board breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by disseminating a materially incomplete and misleading proxy statement in connection with the proposed Merger, and that Perspecta aided and abetted such breach. Both complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining Perspecta from holding the stockholder meeting to vote on the proposed Merger and taking any steps to consummate the proposed Merger or, in the event the proposed Merger is consummated, an order rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger or any terms thereof, or granting rescissory damages, and to recover an unspecified amount of damages resulting from the alleged violations of fiduciary duties. It is possible additional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this proxy statement and consummation of the Merger.

Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the Merger is expected to take place on (i) the date that is two business days following the date on which the last of the conditions to the closing of the Merger (described in ""The Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Completion of the Merger"") has been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the closing date of the Merger, which are required to be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement on the closing date) or (ii) such other date as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

As previously disclosed and reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 10, 2021, by NIC Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""Company"" or ""NIC""), with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), on February 9, 2021, NIC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Tyler Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Tyler Technologies""), and Topos Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyler Technologies (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NIC (the ""Merger"" and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the ""Transactions""), with NIC continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyler Technologies.

On March 2, 2021, NIC filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with the Transactions, and on March 17, 2021, NIC filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement in connection with the Transactions (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement""), which was mailed to NIC stockholders of record on or about March 19, 2021.

Seven complaints have been filed in connection with the Transactions (each, a ""Complaint"", and collectively, the ""Complaints"", and all seven lawsuits, collectively, the ""Merger Litigation""). The plaintiffs in each of the Complaints purport to be stockholders of NIC. Three of the Complaints were filed in federal court in Delaware, one was filed in federal court in New York, one was filed in federal court in New Jersey, and two were filed in state court in Kansas. The Delaware Complaints are captioned Stein v. NIC Inc., et al, No. 1:21-cv-00330 (D. Del.) (filed on March 3, 2021), Starks v. NIC Inc., et al, No. 1:21-cv-00335 (D. Del.) (filed on March 4, 2021), and Lawrence v. NIC Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-00472-UNA (D. Del.) (filed on March 30, 2021). The New York Complaint is captioned Charter v. NIC Inc. et al., No. 1:21-cv-02316 (S.D.N.Y.) (filed on March 17, 2021). The New Jersey Complaint is captioned Killeen v. NIC Inc., et al., No. 3:21-cv-07922 (D.N.J.) (filed on April 1, 2021). The Kansas Complaints are captioned Petris v. NIC Inc., et al. (Dist. Ct. of Johnson Cty., Kansas) (filed on March 26, 2021) and Allison-Holman v. NIC Inc., et al., No. 21-cv-01346 (Dist. Ct. of Johnson Cty., Kansas) (filed on March 30, 2021). The Delaware, New York, and New Jersey Complaints are individual suits (collectively, the ""Individual Complaints""), and the Kansas Complaints are purported class actions on behalf of NIC stockholders. All the Complaints name the Company and all of its directors, and one Complaint also names Harry Herington in his capacity as an officer. The Complaints generally allege that the Definitive Proxy Statement fails to disclose material information and that, as a result, the Definitive Proxy Statement is materially misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and/or that the Company and its directors are liable for breaches of their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and good faith. The alleged undisclosed information includes: (1) a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures; (2) line items used to calculate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and EBIT; (3) certain information about the Company's projections provided to Tyler Technologies; (4) certain information relating to the financial analyses performed by the Company's financial adviser and any ""Wall street consensus forecast"" that was reviewed by the Company's financial advisor and the Board; and (5) certain other information relating to (i) services that the Company's financial advisor previously provided to the Company, (ii) non-disclosure and standstill agreements executed by the Company, (iii) other potential ""financial buyers,"" and (iv) certain alleged statements regarding the potential post-Merger employment of members of Company ""senior management"" by Tyler Technologies. The Complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the Company from consummating the Merger or, in the alternative, rescission of the Merger or damages. The Plaintiff in De Petris has also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which NIC will oppose if it is not withdrawn. Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future.

NIC believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and that no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Merger Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the Transactions and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has determined voluntarily to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement as described in this supplemental disclosure. The plaintiffs in the Individual Complaints have agreed that the amendments address their concerns and will voluntarily dismiss their complaints, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only. Nothing in this supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality, under applicable laws, of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Merger Litigation that any additional disclosure was or is required.

This supplemental disclosure will not affect the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger or the timing of the special meeting of the Company's stockholders, which will be held virtually via the Internet at 11:00 a.m. Central Time on April 19, 2021 (the ""Special Meeting""). The Company's board of directors continues to unanimously recommend that NIC stockholders vote: (a) ""FOR"" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (b) ""FOR"" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to NIC's named executive officers in connection with the Merger and contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (c) ""FOR"" the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

As previously disclosed, on April 24, 2021, New York Community Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""NYCB""), 615 Corp., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NYCB (""Merger Sub""), and Flagstar Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation (""Flagstar""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Flagstar, with Flagstar as the surviving entity (the ""Merger""), and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger, Flagstar will merge with and into NYCB, with NYCB as the surviving entity.

In connection with the proposed Merger, NYCB filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement on Form S-4 containing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, as amended, and Flagstar filed a definitive proxy statement and NYCB filed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC, each dated June 25, 2021 (collectively, the ""joint proxy statement/prospectus""), which NYCB and Flagstar first mailed to their respective stockholders and shareholders on or about June 28, 2021.

Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, eight lawsuits challenging the disclosures contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus or other aspects of the Merger have been filed. The first lawsuit, captioned Shiva Stein v. Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. et al. (Case No. No. 1:21-cv-03347), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on June 14, 2021. The second lawsuit, captioned Alex Ciccotelli v. Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-05406), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 18, 2021. The third lawsuit, captioned Selwyn Karp v. New York Community Bancorp, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-5505), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 23, 2021. The fourth lawsuit, captioned Luis Guitart v. Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-03559), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on June 23, 2021. The fifth lawsuit, captioned Tammy Raul v. New York Community Bancorp., Inc. et al. (Case No. 21-cv-5505) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 23, 2021. The sixth lawsuit, captioned Frank Lawrence v. Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. et al. (Case No. 2021-188820-CB), was filed in the Business Court division of the Oakland County Circuit Court of the State of Michigan on July 1, 2021. The seventh lawsuit, captioned Stephen Bushansky v. New York Community Bancorp., Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-6089), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 15, 2021. The eighth lawsuit, captioned Paul Parshall v. New York Community Bancorp., Inc. et al. (Case No. 1:21-cv-6342), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 26, 2021. The complaints in the Stein, Guitart, Ciccotelli, and Lawrence actions are brought by alleged Flagstar shareholders and assert claims against Flagstar and the members of its board of directors (and, in the case of the Ciccotelli action, NYCB and 615 Corp.). The complaints in the Karp, Raul, Bushansky and Parshall actions are brought by alleged NYCB stockholders and assert claims against NYCB and the members of its board of directors (and, in the case of the Karp action, Flagstar). The complaints filed in the lawsuits allege, among other things, that the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement relating to the proposed Merger to be filed with the SEC in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder or, in the case of the Lawrence action, Michigan law. The Lawrence action also alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty under Michigan law against the members of the Flagstar board contending that the Merger process and proposed consideration are inadequate. We refer to the foregoing lawsuits collectively as the ""Merger Actions.""

NYCB and Flagstar believe that the claims asserted in the Merger Actions referred to above are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to diminish the risk that these Merger Actions delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the Merger Actions, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, NYCB and Flagstar have agreed to supplement the joint proxy statement/prospectus as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. NYCB, Flagstar and the other named defendants deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to NYCB's stockholders or Flagstar's shareholders, as applicable. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, NYCB and Flagstar specifically deny all allegations in these Merger Actions that any additional disclosure was or is required.

As previously disclosed, on December 20, 2021, Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (""Bluerock Residential"" or the ""Company""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Badger Parent LLC (""Parent"") and Badger Merger Sub LLC (""Merger Sub""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the ""Merger""), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Company's board of directors. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P., an affiliate of Blackstone Inc. In addition, as previously disclosed, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company will complete the separation of its single-family residential real estate business (the ""Single-Family Business"") from the Company's multi-family residential real estate business (the ""Separation""). Following the Separation, the Single-Family Business will be indirectly held by Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""Bluerock Homes""), and, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company will distribute the common stock of Bluerock Homes to the Company's common stockholders as of the record date for such distribution in a taxable distribution (the ""Distribution"").

In connection with the proposed Merger, Bluerock Residential filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive proxy statement (the ""Proxy Statement""), which Bluerock Residential first mailed to its stockholders on or about March 11, 2022.

Following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, four lawsuits challenging the Merger have been filed (each, a ""Lawsuit"" and, collectively, the ""Lawsuits""). The Lawsuits are captioned (i) Samuel Marchese v. Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01234, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2022; (ii) Matthew Whitfield v. Ramin Kamfar, et al., No. 24C22001079, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland on February 25, 2022; (iii) Robert Garfield v. Robert Ramin Kamfar, et al., No. 602620/2022, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on March 1, 2022; and (iv) Stephen Bushansky v. Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02482, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 28, 2022. In addition, Bluerock Residential received demand letters from counsel representing individual stockholders of the Company (the ""Demand Letters"" and, together with the Lawsuits, the ""Matters""). The Matters each allege, among other things, that the defendants disseminated a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement relating to the proposed Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.

The Company believes that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit and supplemental disclosures are not required or necessary under applicable laws. However, in order to avoid the risk that the Matters delay or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in defending the lawsuits, and to provide additional information to stockholders, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company has agreed to supplement the Proxy Statement as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Matters that any additional disclosure was or is required. The inclusion in this Current Report on Form 8-K of certain information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives, or any other recipient of this information, considered, or now considers, it to be material, and such information should not be relied upon as such.

By order dated July 11, 2022, the court consolidated the Sydney and Kim cases and set an August 24, 2022 deadline for the Plaintiffs in both cases to file a consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on August 24, 2022. The amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of the Company's preferred stock, among other things, claims for breach of contract against the Company and the former Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary governing the terms of the Company's preferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty against the former Board of Directors, and tortious interference and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against WHLR. On October 7, 2022, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss and filed a motion to certify a question of law to Maryland's Supreme Court. On August 1, 2023, the court issued a decision and order granting Defendants' motions to dismiss, without leave to amend, and denying Plaintiffs' motion to certify a question of law to the Maryland Supreme Court. The Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Case No. 23-1905, docketed on August 30, 2023. The appeal has been fully briefed. At this juncture, the outcome of the litigation remains uncertain.

On July 11, 2022, a purported holder of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a complaint against the Company and the Board of Directors prior to the Merger in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled High Income Securities Fund v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-4031. The complaint alleged that the Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions, and that the former Board of Directors are control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On September 25, 2023, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, and the time within which the Plaintiff could have appealed such decision has passed.

On October 14, 2022, a purported holder of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a putative class action against the Company, the Board of Directors prior to the Merger, and WHLR in Nassau County Supreme Court, New York entitled Krasner v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., (Case No. 613985/2022). The complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of the Company's preferred stock, among other things, claims for breach of contract against the Company and the former Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary governing the terms of the Company's preferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty against the former Board of Directors, and tortious interference and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against WHLR. The complaint seeks, among other relief, an award of monetary damages, attorneys' fees, and expert fees. The Defendants filed motions in the Nassau County action to dismiss or stay the case based both on the pendency of the lawsuit in Maryland in which the same claims were asserted by other preferred stockholders and on the merits. The court held a hearing on the motions on October 27, 2023, and on December 4, 2023 granted the motions to dismiss based on the pendency of the lawsuit in Maryland without addressing the merits.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Step 1: Search for Keyword ""Class Action""**

The LLM identified explicit mentions of ""class action"" within the filing excerpts. The mentions of both the Doggett and Turlington cases, which are noted as class action petitions, are found in the 2023-02-22 Form 10-K.

**Step 2: Confirm Class Action Mention**

There are no contradictions or misinterpretations of the data present in the excerpts. The LLM's response aligns with the instructions provided, which ask for explicit keyword evidence and correct categorization based on that evidence.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

On March 24, 2023, Martin Siegel, a purported Luther Burbank Corporation shareholder, filed and served a putative class action on behalf of our shareholders in the Superior Court for the County of Sonoma, California captioned Siegel v. Lagomarsino, et al. (Case No. SCV-272922). The Siegel complaint alleges that our board of directors breached their fiduciary duty by failing to disclose certain internal projections and other information allegedly underlying the fairness opinion of our financial adviser, Piper Sandler & Co., in connection with our pending merger transaction with Washington Federal, Inc. Following the filing of our Current Report on Form 8-K on April 10, 2023 containing certain supplemental information regarding unaudited prospective financial estimates received and considered by Piper Sandler & Co., Mr. Siegel withdrew his request for a preliminary injunction to require us to disclose the internal projections and other information and to delay our May 4, 2023 shareholders meeting, but reserved the right to seek an award of attorney's fees and expenses. On May 9, 2023, Siegel and his counsel filed an amended complaint alleging unjust enrichment and seeking an award of attorney's fees and expenses and removing their prior disclosure based claims.

In addition, two other purported Luther Burbank Corporation shareholders have filed similar actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended in matters captioned Wang v. Luther Burbank Corporation, et al. (Civil Action No. 23-cv-01949) and O'Dell v. Luther Burbank Corporation, et al.

- The LLM correctly identifies the target case as Siegel v. Lagomarsino, et al. (Case No. SCV-272922) by matching the case number in the filing excerpts with the target case information.
- The LLM finds and quotes the sentence from the filing excerpts: ""On March 24, 2023, Martin Siegel, a purported Luther Burbank Corporation shareholder, filed and served a putative class action on behalf of our shareholders in the Superior Court for the County of Sonoma, California captioned Siegel v.

Step 2: Check if the LLM's response diverges from task instructions:

- The LLM follows the task instructions by first searching for mentions of ""class action"" or similar terms.
- The LLM confirms the relevant keyword clearly refers to the target case as a ""putitive class action,"" which aligns with the instructions.
- The LLM correctly outputs ""Yes"" for ""is_class_action"" based on the explicit mention in the document. The JSON object produced by the LLM response includes the sentence that makes the classification clear and the correct note explaining the finding.

Conclusion:

The LLM's response is consistent with the task instructions and accurately interprets the provided excerpts. The conclusion that the case is a class action due to the explicit mention ""putative class action"" is correct. There are no hallucinations in this response.

2023-04-03 Form 8-K [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1060219/000155479523000106/sal0403form8k.htm]:
On December 5, 2022, NBT Bancorp Inc. (""NBT"") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. (""Salisbury""), Salisbury Bank and Trust Company (""Salisbury Bank""), Salisbury's subsidiary bank, and NBT Bank, N.A. (""NBT Bank""), NBT's subsidiary bank, pursuant to which Salisbury will merge with and into NBT, with NBT as the surviving entity.

In connection with the Merger, NBT filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (333-269742) (as amended, the ""Registration Statement"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). On February 28, 2023, the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. On March 1, NBT filed a definitive proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the special meeting of shareholders of Salisbury scheduled to be held on April 12, 2023 at which Salisbury shareholders will be asked to, among other things, vote on a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement (the ""Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus"").

Since the initial filing of the Registration Statement, six purported shareholders of Salisbury sent demand letters (the ""Demand Letters"") requesting that Salisbury provide additional disclosures in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. In addition, two purported class action lawsuits have been filed against Salisbury, NBT and each of the members of the board of directors of Salisbury in the Superior Court of the Judicial District of Litchfield, Connecticut (collectively, the ""Complaints""). Captioned Reinhardt v. Salisbury Bancorp, Inc., et. al. (LLI-CV-23-6032958S), filed on March 17, 2023, and Parshall v. Salisbury Bancorp, Inc., et. al. (LLI-CV23-6033021), filed on March 28,2023, each of the Complaints alleges that the named directors of Salisbury breached their fiduciary duties by approving the Merger Agreement through an unfair and flawed process and by failing to make complete and accurate disclosures regarding this process and that Salisbury and NBT aid and abetted the alleged breaches. Each of the Complaints seeks to enjoin the merger and requests attorneys' fees and damages in an unspecified amount. NBT and Salisbury believe these allegations are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

While NBT and Salisbury believe that the Complaints and the Demand Letters lack merit and that the disclosures set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' unmeritorious disclosure claims, avoid nuisance and possible expense and provide additional information to Salisbury's shareholders, NBT and Salisbury have determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Nothing in Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, NBT and Salisbury specifically deny all allegations that any additional disclosure was or is required.
