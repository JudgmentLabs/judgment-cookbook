The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made.

At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019CV30601
- **case name**: Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-06-18
- **case count**: District Court of Boulder County, Colorado
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""One action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the sentence that follows provides more context:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This suggests that the supplemental disclosures were related to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned as part of an agreement discussion.""
}
```",NOBLAW39638738,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The Filing Excerpts confirm that the Target Case, Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601, is mentioned specifically. Therefore, the LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case is discussed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The Filing Excerpts state, ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" While they mention that ""each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot"" in light of these disclosures, the LLM infers that the disclosures were made in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, the text does not explicitly state that the disclosures were specifically in response to any lawsuit. It can be seen as an inference, but without explicit confirmation, the LLM's conclusion that the company made supplemental disclosures ""in response to"" the lawsuit is a misinterpretation, as the only explicit link is the statement about the complaints being dismissed as moot.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

There is no mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU."" This assessment matches the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly identifies that no specific ""XXX agreement"" was mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No strong implication of an agreement exists, and this is noted correctly by the LLM.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

This step is not applicable as no explicit or implied agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The conclusion about the supplemental disclosure might not be strictly according to the explicit instruction requiring the disclosure to be explicitly stated as in response to the lawsuit. While tying the voluntary dismissal as an implicit response is reasonable, the text should explicitly indicate this link in the context of a legal analysis. Nonetheless, given the interpretation that the dismissals were due to the supplemental disclosure indicates relevance, the LLM's interpretation is plausible yet slightly stretches the task instruction. However, this is based more on inference.

JSON:
```json
{
    ""analysis"": ""The LLM successfully identifies the mentioned Target Case and correctly ascertains the absence of an explicit agreement. However, it may stretch the instruction that requires explicit linkage of the supplemental disclosure to the lawsuit. The text provides underlying reasonable context but doesn't explicitly specify the response linkage required by the task. This is an inferential leap rather than a clear hallucination."",
    ""hallucination"": false

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al."" with case number 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" as one of the actions filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019, as stated in the section ""ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"". The supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The provided excerpts mention the case ""Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al.,"" with the case number 2019CV30601, as one of the actions filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the merger. The LLM correctly identified the discussion surrounding the Target Case.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The excerpts state, ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."" The LLM correctly identified this statement as indicating supplemental disclosure made by the Company. The LLM also recognized that this action relates to the complaints, including the Target Case, due to the general context in which the actions were filed against the merger.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The response noted that no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case exists, which is consistent with the excerpts provided. This assessment is accurate.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
Upon reviewing the excerpts, there is no mention of any formal agreement or resolution related to the Target Case, which aligns with the LLM's response.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The analysis found no indication of an implied agreement related to the Target Case. This finding aligns with the information provided in the excerpts.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
Since no agreements were identified, there is no need to confirm their relation to the Target Case. The LLM correctly followed this step by not addressing this aspect further.

Step 7: Summarize the Results
The final conclusions are that the Company made supplemental disclosures that are associated with the Target Case. However, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to such cases. These conclusions are consistent with the provided information.

Final Analysis:

"<filing_excerpts>
In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company accrues for losses related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. At this time, the Company does not believe that it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses related to the matters described below.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. ยง220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""One action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601.""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following paragraph:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. The supplemental disclosure is specifically mentioned to be in response to the lawsuits, and the Target Case is one of the lawsuits mentioned.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. However, I found that the complaints, including the Target Case, were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Although there is no explicit agreement, the fact that the complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot after the Company issued supplemental disclosures implies that the parties may have reached an agreement. However, this is not a strong implication, and I will err on the side of caution.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no explicit agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM accurately identified the Target Case, Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601, as being mentioned in the filing excerpts. Thus, the case is indeed discussed in the provided content.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure

The LLM states that the Company issued supplemental disclosures, which led to the voluntary dismissal of the complaints. The excerpts do mention that ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019,"" and that the complaints were thereafter voluntarily dismissed. This is consistent with the instructions that require either the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, the LLM correctly identifies that supplemental disclosure was made in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement

The LLM correctly notes the absence of any explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. The filing excerpts do not mention either term or anything explicitly indicating a settlement.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements

The LLM accurately did not find any explicit mention of another formal agreement related to the Target Case.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement

The LLM does not assert a strong implication of an agreement besides the voluntary dismissal due to supplemental disclosures. This is in line with the instructions to err on the side of caution if there is no explicit terminology.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case

Since there is no explicit agreement found impacting the Target Case, this step was correctly deemed unnecessary.

Step 7: Summarize the Results

The LLM's final summarization accurately explains that supplemental disclosure was made with respect to the lawsuits, including the Target Case, but no explicit agreement such as ""Settlement Agreement,"" ""MOU,"" or any other formal agreement was confirmed.

Conclusion

The LLM's response aligns well with the given instructions and provided excerpts. There are no hallucinations in the LLM's reasoning as it accurately interpreted the information and provided consistent answers to the questions based on the content.

ITEM 1. | LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER"". Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints, including the Target Case. The relevant quote is:

""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. However, there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```",X1Q6NVUDSV82,TRUE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion

The Target Case, Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), is indeed mentioned in the filing excerpts under the section ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER."" Therefore, the LLM has correctly identified that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure

The filing excerpts contain a statement where the Company expresses its intention to make supplemental disclosures in response to the allegations raised in the complaints, including the Target Case. The LLM correctly identifies this statement as the basis for answering ""Yes"" to the presence of supplemental disclosures, and it provides an accurate quote from the excerpts.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement

The LLM correctly notes that there is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the provided excerpts.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements

No explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" related to the Target Case is present in the excerpts, and the LLM accurately reflects this finding.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement

There is no strong implication of any agreement in the filing excerpts pertaining to the Target Case. The LLM's analysis correctly notes the absence of such implications.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case

Since no agreements were found, this step is not applicable. The LLM correctly concludes that no further analysis is needed in this respect.

Step 7: Summarize the Results

The LLM accurately summarizes that the Company did make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, including the Target Case. It correctly concludes that there are no explicit or implied agreements related to the Target Case.

Conclusion: The LLM has correctly followed the task instructions and provided accurate information based on the excerpts. There are no hallucinations present in the response.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints described above, including the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.),"" is mentioned in the provided filing excerpts. This step is completed correctly, with no hallucination present.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM states that the Company voluntarily made supplemental disclosures in response to allegations, including those related to the Target Case. The filing excerpts do say: ""The Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

There is no indication that the supplemental disclosures are specifically linked to the Target Case. However, since no evidence suggests different lawsuits in the disclosures, it assumes inclusion in the response.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM accurately reports that there is no explicit indication of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" pertaining to the Target Case within the provided filing excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM accurately identifies that no formal agreement described as an ""XXX agreement"" is mentioned in relation to the Target Case within the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no mention or suggestion of an implied agreement in the text. The LLM correctly determines this step isn't relevant based on the provided information.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was mentioned, confirming relevance to the Target Case is unnecessary. The LLM rightly skips this step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The conclusion that supplemental disclosures were made in response to the lawsuit is consistent with the Filing Excerpts' narrative of voluntarily issuing such disclosures related to the merger and complaints. However, it does not specify that these specifically relate to the Target Case. As no conflicting evidence is present, the LLM isn't technically incorrect, even if it makes an assumption that may not be explicitly supported.

The LLM correctly concludes no explicit settlement or other agreement for the Target Case.

**Final Determination:**
The LLM's response doesn't contain a hallucination regarding supplemental disclosure or agreements, although its conclusion relies on an unexplicit assumption about the Target Case. It's possible to interpret the decision favorably, given the lack of specificity in the excerpt, yet the analysis was cautiously applied.

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v.

Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",

}",X1Q6NVUDSV82,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Analysis of the LLM Response:**

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM begins by identifying the Target Case as ""Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.)"". The excerpts confirm that this case is mentioned, as it is listed among the putative class action lawsuits filed against the Company. The LLM does not hallucinate in this step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM accurately finds a sentence indicating that the Company filed a First Supplement to make voluntary supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to allegations raised in the complaints. The mention of ""complaints described above"" can reasonably be interpreted to include the Target Case, as it is listed among those cases. Thus, for the question of the supplemental disclosure, the LLM accurately concludes ""Yes"". There is no hallucination in this step.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM searches for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case but finds none. This step aligns with the excerpts, which do not discuss any settlement. Therefore, this step is accurate and free from hallucination.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM does not find any formal agreement related to the Target Case, consistent with the content of the excerpts. Therefore, this step is correctly executed with no hallucination.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM finds no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case, which is consistent with the provided excerpts. Thus, the LLM correctly completes this step without any hallucination.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Because no agreements were found, there is no additional requirement for this step. The LLM's decision to note that this step is not applicable is consistent with the process flow.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

In summarizing the results, the LLM provides accurate information:
- **""Yes""** for supplemental disclosure with a correct quote.
- **""No""** for reached agreement, as no agreement evidence was found.
- The ""note"" accurately mentions the presence of the Target Case in the excerpts.

Overall, the LLM's response is coherent with the excerpt information and follows the task instructions correctly. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences from the guidelines.

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement.

None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER"". Therefore, I can confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the section ""SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES"", I found that the Company ""wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above."" This indicates that the Company is making supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.
* There is no explicit settlement or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

The LLM correctly identifies the Target Case mentioned in the Filing Excerpts as Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.). This matches the information provided in the Filing Excerpts under ""LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER.""

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM states that the Company ""wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures ... in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above."" Given that the filings describe the Company's intent to make supplemental disclosures specifically citing various lawsuits, including the Bartholomew case, the LLM correctly identifies this information and associates it with the lawsuit, legitimately answering ""Yes"" to the supplemental disclosure query.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM accurately reports that no ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The search for explicit formal agreements other than a settlement or MOU yields no results in the Filing Excerpts, and the LLM correctly reports this.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No implied agreements are suggested in the Filing Excerpts. The LLM's conclusion aligns with the information provided.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement exists, this step is inapplicable, which the LLM correctly concludes.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM accurately summarizes the results: A supplemental disclosure is confirmed, but no explicit or implied agreement is found concerning the Target Case. Hence, the LLM concludes correctly with ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure and ""No"" for an agreement.

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case.

The LLM correctly identified the mention of the Target Case, Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), in the provided excerpts. The excerpts confirmed that this case was filed as one of several class action lawsuits against the Company. Therefore, the LLM followed the instructions correctly in this step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM found that the Company filed the First Supplement with supplemental disclosures related to the merger ""in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above,"" as stated in the excerpts. Since the Bartholomew case is one of the lawsuits mentioned earlier, the response of the Company does indeed pertain to this Target Case. Therefore, the LLM accurately stated that there was a supplemental disclosure in response to the Target Case lawsuits.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly searched for but did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"". There was no indication of any settlement being explicitly mentioned related to the Target Case in the excerpts, meaning the LLM's response was correct in identifying there was no explicit settlement.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM did not find any formal ""XXX agreement"" in the provided excerpts, aligning with the information in the text. Therefore, its conclusion that no other agreements existed is consistent with the provided information.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM reported no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case, which aligns with the excerpts that lack any implicit agreement indications. This conclusion is correctly drawn from the available information.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

As there was no agreement found, this step does not apply. The LLM appropriately recognized this inapplicability based on its analysis.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The final output presented by the LLM aligns accurately with the steps and findings throughout its analysis. The assertions that the supplemental disclosure was made are backed by explicit evidence, and its classification of no agreements based on the absence of such mentions in the excerpts is consistent with the instructions.

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), is mentioned in the filing excerpts. This confirmation is accurate as the case is clearly referenced in the text.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The LLM adequately finds and quotes a portion of the filing that indicates the Company intends to make supplemental disclosures in response to the litigation. The statement provided from the excerpts confirms this: ""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above."" Based on this, the LLM's answer of ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure is justified.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The LLM correctly asserts that there is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case found in the excerpts.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
The LLM states that there is no formal ""XXX agreement"" found in the excerpts, and this is consistent with the provided materials, as no such agreement is mentioned.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The LLM correctly identifies that there is no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
Since no agreements were found, this step is appropriately concluded with a ""No"" for reached agreement.

Final Analysis
The LLM correctly identified the mention of the Target Case, properly classified the supplemental disclosure as ""Yes"" based on direct evidence, and accurately determined ""No"" for the reached agreement, as there were no mentions of agreements in the excerpts. The LLM's response was consistent with the task instructions, and no hallucinations were present in its interpretation of the provided excerpts.

The following information supplements the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" beginning on page 21 of the Definitive Proxy Statement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. After receiving comments from the staff of the SEC, the Company amended its proxy statement in response to such comments, and on May 4, 2018, the Company filed the Definitive Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaints generally alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement or Definitive Proxy Statement, as applicable, allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the applicable proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 17, 2018, Carl Icahn contacted Mr. Zyskind and informed Mr. Zyskind that he and his affiliates (the ""Icahn 13D Parties"") had acquired approximately 9.4% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and intended on soliciting proxies against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Later that day, representatives of Paul, Weiss spoke with Mr. Icahn and one of his associates and discussed Mr. Icahn's opposition to the transaction. The parties subsequently arranged for Mr. Icahn to meet with Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel on May 22, 2018.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio)"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""...from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions,... (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio)...""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, I need to confirm that the lawsuit is the Target Case. The sentence mentions ""the complaints described above"", which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the supplemental disclosure is related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which is the Target Case. However, I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio),"" is explicitly mentioned in the filing excerpts. This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed within the documents.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The LLM locates a statement that indicates supplemental disclosure was made:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

The LLM associates this supplemental disclosure with the Target Case because the filing mentions it is in response to ""complaints described above,"" which includes the Target Case. This alignment with the details in the task instructions is accurate, as the supplemental disclosure pertains to the mentioned complaints.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The LLM accurately identifies the absence of an explicit settlement agreement or MOU in the filing excerpts. The response correctly notes that no explicit settlement related to the Target Case is present.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
The LLM correctly observes that there is no mention of any other formal agreements associated with the Target Case.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The LLM correctly identifies that there is no strong implication of an implied agreement concerning the Target Case based on the text excerpts.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
This step is unnecessary in this specific case as no agreement was identified concerning the Target Case.

Step 7: Summarize the Results
The LLM correctly concludes that supplemental disclosure was made in response to the Target Case but that no explicit or implied agreement with the Target Case exists.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints, including the one filed in the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I found supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

}",X1Q6O03AG182,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The task requires confirming discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440."" From the provided excerpts, the Raul case is indeed mentioned among several cases related to possible violations by the company with respect to the merger. Thus, the LLM correctly confirmed the presence of discussions regarding the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step involves checking if the Company made any supplemental disclosures or amendments in response to the lawsuit. According to the excerpts, the Company did voluntarily decide to make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations from the complaints, explicitly including the allegations in the Target Case, among others. Therefore, the LLM correctly identified that the Company made supplemental disclosures associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The task then asks whether there is an explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"". Upon reviewing the excerpts, no mention of a settlement agreement or an MOU specific to the Target Case was found. Therefore, the LLM is correct in stating that no explicit settlement was identified.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The following step requires checking for any other formal agreements. However, there is no evidence in the provided excerpts of formal ""XXX agreements"" related to resolving the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No strong implication of an agreement outside of the explicit terms was discovered within the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

This step typically confirms the applicability of the agreement, but as no agreements besides the supplemental disclosures were found, this validation was not necessary.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The final summary aligns with the findings: ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosures because they were made in response to the lawsuit, and ""No"" for reaching an explicit agreement related to the Target Case because none were found.

**Conclusion**

The LLM's response is accurate, with no hallucinations detected. The response correctly interprets the information from the excerpts and follows the task's instructions precisely.

In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""As previously disclosed in the First Supplement, following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, from May 9, 2018 through May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board under the following captions, (i) Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.), (ii) Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), (iii) Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio), (iv) Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.), and (v) Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.).""

The Target Case is indeed mentioned, so I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

}
```",X1Q6O03AG182,TRUE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

- The Target Case, ""Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.),"" is indeed mentioned in the filing excerpts. The LLM correctly identifies this mention and proceeds to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- The filing excerpts state, ""On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above."" This includes the Target Case among the identified lawsuits, confirming the Company's supplemental disclosure was a response. The LLM's response matches this observation accurately, answering ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure.""

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

- The filing excerpts do not mention any explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" tied to the Target Case or any of the associated cases. The LLM identifies this correctly, finding no explicit settlement or MOU.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

- The filing excerpts do not present any formal ""XXX agreement"" or resolution associated with the Target Case. The LLM also correctly identifies no such agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

- There is no strong implication of an agreement without explicit mention in the excerpts related to the Target Case. The LLM correctly concludes there is no implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

- The LLM finds no agreement, so this step confirming applicability to the Target Case does not apply.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

- The LLM concludes ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement,"" consistent with the provided information and task instructions.

**Final Analysis**

- The LLM's response accurately reflects the content of the filing excerpts and the task instructions. There is no evidence of hallucination in its response.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Following the filing by the Company of its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on May 4, 2018, in connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement by and among Evergreen Parent, Evergreen Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the Company, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints were substantially identical and alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. On July 6, 2018, the Bartholomew and Myhre actions were voluntarily dismissed.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock), Evergreen Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints alleged that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the definitive proxy statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the preliminary proxy statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure was provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees. The Shust, Raul and Rabinowitz actions were voluntarily dismissed on August 29, 2018, September 7, 2018 and July 23, 2018, respectively.

On May 31, 2018, Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System, City of Lauderhill Police Officers' Retirement System and West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, Stone Point, Trident Pine Acquisition LP (""Trident Pine""), Trident VII Professionals Fund, Trident VII, Trident VII DE Parallel Fund, and Trident VII Parallel Fund (collectively, the ""Trident Funds"") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0396-AGB (the ""2018 Pompano Action""). The complaint in the 2018 Pompano Action alleges that defendants Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, L. Karfunkel, Gulkowitz, Fisch, DeCarlo, and Rivera breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The complaint alleges additional claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as officers and directors of the Company and as controlling stockholders of the Company. The complaint alleges that Stone Point, Trident Pine and the Trident Funds aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 4, 2018, Cambridge filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company's board of directors, the Estate of Michael Karfunkel, Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, LLC, Merger Sub, Trident Pine and Stone Point in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2018-0402-AGB (the ""2018 Cambridge Action""). On September 24, 2018, Plaintiff in the 2018 Cambridge Action filed a Verified Supplemental and Amended Stockholder class action complaint (the ""Amended Complaint""). Similar to the 2018 Pompano Action, the Amended Complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties, which resulted in an unfair merger stock price through an unfair process. The Estate of Michael Karfunkel is not named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges an additional claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Zyskind, G. Karfunkel, and L. Karfunkel in their capacity as controlling shareholders of the Company and alleges that Evergreen Parent, K-Z Evergreen, Merger Sub, Stone Point, and Trident Pine aided and abetted the foregoing breaches of fiduciary duties.

On October 10, 2018, the court directed counsel in the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action to file a proposed order to formally consolidate the 2018 Pompano Action and the 2018 Cambridge Action, designate the lead plaintiffs, and provide for the designation or filing of an operative consolidated complaint.

The Company believes the allegations in the merger litigation described above are without merit.

Other than as discussed above, the Company is not involved presently in any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company or its properties.

12. Segments

The Company operates three business segments: Small Commercial Business; Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty; and Specialty Program. The Corporate and Other segment represents the activities of the holding company as well as a portion of service and fee income. Investment income and realized gains (losses) on investments are determined by calculating an overall annual return on cash and invested assets and applying that overall return to the cash and invested assets by segment. Ceding commission is allocated to each segment based on that segment's proportionate share of the Company's overall acquisition costs. Interest expense is allocated based on gross written premiums by segment. Income taxes are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, management reviews the performance of underwriting results in assessing the performance of and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. Underwriting results excludes, primarily, service and fee income, investment income and other revenues, other expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Management believes that providing information in this manner is essential to providing the Company's stockholders with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance.

The Company allocates certain underwriting, general and administrative (""U, G & A"") expenses to its operating segments, and regularly assesses the allocation assumptions and methodologies. In the current period, the Company changed how it allocates U, G & A expenses to the respective operating segments. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the Company began allocating all U, G & A expenses based on net earned premiums to better align its shared expenses with premiums earned, which provides the chief operating decision maker with information to properly assess segment performance based on the current circumstances of the underlying business mix within segments. In prior periods, portions of U, G & A expenses were allocated based on various metrics. Prior period amounts have been revised using the new allocation methodology for comparability.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, neither Small Commercial Business nor Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty derived over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Specialty Program did not derive over ten percent of its total revenue from one customer. Specialty Program derived over ten percent of its total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from a customer that was formerly a consolidated entity and was included in the transfer of the U.S.-based fee businesses completed on February 28, 2018. See Note 13. ""Divestiture"" for additional information on the transfer.

The following tables summarize the results of operations of the business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"". Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that the complaint in the 2018 Cambridge Action was amended, but this is not directly related to the Target Case. I also found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits, but it is not clear if this is related to the Target Case. However, I found that the Raul action was voluntarily dismissed on September 7, 2018, which suggests that the dismissal might be related to supplemental disclosure. 

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that there is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the voluntary dismissal of the Raul action on September 7, 2018, might imply an agreement, but it is not strongly implied.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits, but it is not clear if this is related to the Target Case. However, the Raul action was voluntarily dismissed on September 7, 2018, which suggests that the dismissal might be related to supplemental disclosure. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

}",X1Q6O03AG182,TRUE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies and confirms that the Target CaseโRaul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440โis discussed in the provided filing excerpts. This is an accurate interpretation.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM concludes that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits but does not clarify if it pertains directly to the Target Case. According to the task instructions, a clear connection must be established between the supplemental disclosure and the Target Case for the response to be ""Yes."" The LLM assumes a relationship between the voluntary dismissal of the Raul case and supplemental disclosure without explicit evidence. The LLM correctly notes that it is unclear whether the disclosure relates to the Target Case, so it should have concluded with ""No"" based on the instructions because there is no explicit linkage.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM accurately states that there is no mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the filing excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution related to the Target Case, adhering to the task instructions.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM mentions the voluntary dismissal of the Raul action might imply an agreement but correctly notes it is not strongly implied, which aligns with the task instructions.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

The LLM concludes this step is not applicable as there is no explicit or implied agreement, which is accurate.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM misinterprets the requirements for identifying supplemental disclosure by concluding ""Yes"" despite lacking explicit mention that links the disclosure to the Target Case. The correct response should have been ""No.""

Final Determination: The LLM has made a hallucination by incorrectly labeling the Company's actions as having made supplemental disclosure explicitly related to the Target Case.

The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on pages 23-24 as follows:

Also in early January, counsel to the Trident Funds, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (""Skadden""), and counsel to the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (""Paul, Weiss""), negotiated joint bidding arrangements related to a potential proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of common stock not held or controlled by the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and its affiliates and certain related parties, including (1) that the new cash investment by Stone Point and the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family, together with the rollover of shares of common stock of the Company acquired in the May 2017 private placement, would be in the form of preferred equity; and (2) that there would be an adjustment in the ownership interests between holders of preferred equity and common equity at the time of a future IPO or other exit event if at such time there was a reserve deficiency or reserve excess with respect to premiums earned on or prior to March 31, 2018, subject to a cap and cut-back depending on the internal rate of return achieved by Trident on its investment (the ""reserve adjustment""); and (3) that Mr. Zyskind would serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer after completion of a transaction.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.).""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found the following paragraph:

""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This indicates that the Company is making supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. Therefore, the answer to the first question is ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any indication of an implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the final answers are:

{

}",X1Q6O03Q3982,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step to identify any hallucination:

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.), is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. This step is accurate as the case is explicitly referenced in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The Filing Excerpts mention that the Company voluntarily wishes to make supplemental disclosures to avoid any delays or adverse effects on the merger due to litigation. The LLM correctly interprets this as the Company making supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuits, which include the Target Case. Therefore, the answer to the first question about supplemental disclosure is correctly marked as ""Yes"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM correctly states there is no mention of an explicit settlement agreement or MOU in relation to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. This step is consistent with the excerpts provided.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
The LLM mentions there is no formal ""XXX agreement"" related to the Target Case found in the filings, which is accurate as no such agreement is discussed in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
The LLM states there is no strongly implied agreement regarding the Target Case, which aligns with the provided excerpts since there are no implications of an agreement beyond the disclosed information.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
This step is not applicable, as no agreement was found in prior steps.

**Final Assessment of the LLM's Response**
The LLM's response follows the task instructions methodically, identifying the supplemental disclosure and correctly noting the absence of any agreement related to the Target Case. There is no indication of a hallucination as the analysis aligns with the provided context without errors.

On May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a Schedule 13D reflecting their aggregate ownership of approximately 9.4% ownership stake in the Company. The filing disclosed that the Icahn 13D Parties acquired their positions in the belief that the shares were undervalued. In addition, on May 17, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn delivered a demand, pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL, to the Company requesting access to certain stocklist materials of the Company.

Earlier that day, Mr. Icahn delivered an open letter to the Board, which stated that he opposed the merger and intended to solicit proxies against the transaction. The letter also requested that the Company move the record date such that shares held by the Icahn 13D Parties would be able to vote on the merger. In addition, on May 17, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, urging the Company's stockholders to vote against the Merger Agreement proposal at the special meeting.

On May 21, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and sought, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, but did not seek to enjoin the merger.

In the afternoon on May 22, 2018, Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel, along with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Company's proxy solicitor, met with Mr. Icahn and his associates to discuss the transaction. Mr. Zyskind and Mr. Karfunkel informed Mr. Icahn that they believed that $13.50 per share was a fair price, particularly given the current issues faced by the Company and summarized in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement titled ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger,"" and that they were not prepared to increase the merger consideration at such time.

Also on May 22, 2018, the Company delivered an investor presentation to Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), which provided in part that the merger was the result of a robust process and removed significant business risks and uncertainties. The presentation was also filed as an exhibit to Schedule 14A.

On May 23, 2018, the Icahn 13D Parties filed an amendment to their preliminary proxy statement and also delivered an investor presentation to ISS, asking ISS to recommend that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In response, on May 24, 2018, the Company delivered a supplemental presentation to Glass Lewis & Co. (""Glass Lewis"") and ISS disputing some of the Icahn 13D Parties' claims. The next day, the Company issued a press release announcing the recommendation by Glass Lewis that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders.

On May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in the First Supplement should be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth therein. The Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required.

On May 25, 2018, ISS's report was released, which recommended that stockholders vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders, and the Icahn 13D Parties filed a supplemental investor presentation contesting certain of the claims in the Company's supplemental presentation.

Over the course of the next week, members of the Special Committee along with representatives of the Special Committee and the Company met with representatives of the Company's largest stockholders to solicit their support for the merger and also met with representatives of the proxy advisory firms to seek such firms' endorsement of the merger.

On May 29, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing that proxy advisory firm Egan-Jones joined Glass Lewis in recommending that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the transaction.

On June 1, 2018, certain affiliates of Mr. Icahn informed the Company that they would assert appraisal rights with respect to their shares, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

Based on a preliminary assessment of proxies received by the Company's proxy solicitor as of June 3, 2018, it appeared that sufficient proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement under Section 251 of the DGCL had been obtained, but that sufficient proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement from a majority of Public Stockholders would not be obtained. Accordingly, Parent determined to request that the Company adjourn the special meeting in order to allow the Company additional time to solicit further support for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

On June 3, 2018, Mr. Zyskind contacted Mr. Icahn and informed him that Parent would be requesting that the Company adjourn the special meeting and requested a meeting with Mr. Icahn to discuss the transaction. Paul, Weiss and an associate of Mr. Icahn also had discussions regarding the request to adjourn the special meeting. In addition, on June 3, 2018, the Special Committee met with its legal advisors to discuss the current status of the transaction, which included a discussion of Mr. Icahn's previous statements.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided filing excerpts. The Target Case is ""Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Barry D. Zyskind, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0358-AGB; Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al."" filed on May 21, 2018, in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Upon reviewing the filing excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that on May 24, 2018, the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The task requires confirming whether the Target Case (""Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Barry D. Zyskind, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0358-AGB; Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al."") is discussed in the filing excerpts. The provided text does indeed mention this case, fulfilling the task's first step. The LLM accurately identifies the presence of the Target Case in the discussion.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The task instructs to ascertain if the Company made or planned to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. The filing excerpts explicitly state that the Company filed the First Supplement to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures in response to certain allegations in the complaints. The LLM correctly identifies the supplemental disclosure and its context in relation to the lawsuit.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The task then directs searching for any explicit mention of a Settlement Agreement or MOU. According to the excerpts, there are no mentions of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case, which the LLM correctly identifies.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
The task advises searching for any formal agreements that indicate a resolution. The excerpts provide no explicit mention of other types of agreements, which the LLM also correctly identifies.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The task directs identifying if an agreement is strongly implied. The LLM notes there is no strong implication of any agreement in the excerpts, aligning with the task instructions.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
Given that no agreement was found in the previous steps, there is nothing to confirm in this step. The step is not applicable in this context, and the LLM correctly proceeds accordingly.

Step 7: Summarize the Results
The LLM summarizes the findings accurately, noting that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit but found no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM did not hallucinate in its response. The findings were consistent with the task instructions and supported by the provided excerpts.

Following the filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement, on May 9, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed putative class action lawsuits against the Company and members of the Board (other than Mr. Serock) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Bartholomew v.

AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04178 (S.D.N.Y.) and Myhre v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04175 (S.D.N.Y.), respectively. The complaints are substantially identical and allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the ""Exchange Act"") because the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2018 (the ""Preliminary Proxy Statement"") allegedly omitted material information with respect to the merger, thus rendering the Preliminary Proxy Statement false and misleading. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger and costs of the applicable action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 15, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, captioned Shust v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01129 (N.D. Ohio). On May 18, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and members of the Board in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Raul v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04440 (S.D.N.Y.). On May 21, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, members of the Board, Parent, Merger Sub and Stone Point in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 (S.D.N.Y.). Similar to the complaints described above, the complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act because the Definitive Proxy Statement, in the case of the Shust complaint and the Rabinowitz complaint, and the Preliminary Proxy Statement, in the case of the Raul complaint, omitted or misrepresented material information concerning the merger. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger unless additional disclosure is provided and costs of the applicable action, including for plaintiff attorneys' and experts' fees.

On May 21, 2018, purported stockholders of the Company filed a complaint against the Company and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. Zyskind, et al., Case No. 2018-0358 (Del. Ch.). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the Company and seeks, among other things, a declaration that the merger was not entirely fair and an order rescinding the merger or granting an award of rescissory damages, interest and expenses, including reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

The Company believes that no further disclosure is required to supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk that the litigations described above may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the merger and to minimize the expense of defending such actions, the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above. Nothing in this Supplement shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the complaints described above that any additional disclosure was or is required. The information contained in this Supplement is incorporated by reference into the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the extent that information in this Supplement differs from or updates information contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement, the information in this Supplement shall supersede or supplement the information in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Unless stated otherwise, new text is bolded and underlined to highlight the supplemental information being provided to you and deleted text is bolded and denoted by a strike-through.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Special Committee; Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Fairness of the Merger"" on page 5 as follows:

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis of the other factors described below (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (""Deutsche Bank"")), which the Board adopted as its own, the Board unanimously resolved on behalf of the Company that the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Unaffiliated Stockholders, approved the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 21 as follows:

From time to time, during the two year period preceding the execution of the Merger Agreement, representatives of the Company have held discussions with representatives of various strategic and financial sponsor parties regarding potential strategic transactions involving the Company, including discussions in November and December 2017 related to a potential going-private transaction with five other parties. None of the discussions with those five other parties in November and December 2017 developed beyond a preliminary nature or resulted in any proposal. Except as discussed below or as previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC, none of those discussions progressed beyond the preliminary phase. In connection with those discussions, the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements with several parties, including three of the five parties referenced above. As of the date of this proxy statement, pursuant to action taken by the Special Committee under the Merger Agreement, none of the parties with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality and standstill agreements is prohibited by the terms of such agreements from making offers to acquire the Company.

The following disclosures amend and supplement the existing disclosures contained under the heading ""Special Factors--Background of the Merger"" on page 22 as follows:

In the context of Stone Point's due diligence investigation, and inquiries from and preliminary discussions with other financial sponsor parties in November and December 2017 regarding a potential going-private referred to above, on December 7, 2017, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family amended its Schedule 13D to state that the members of the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family were considering plans and proposals with respect to their investments in the Company that could result in any of the events described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Therefore, I can confirm that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

```",X1Q6O03QDD82,TRUE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response based on the task instructions and provided excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identified that the Rabinowitz v. AmTrust Fin'l Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-04484 is mentioned in the filing excerpts provided. This aligns with the target case description, confirming that the case is discussed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM states that the Company made supplemental disclosures related to the merger in response to certain allegations raised in the complaints, including the Rabinowitz complaint. The LLM quotes: ""The Company believes that no further disclosure is required...; however, to avoid the risk... the Company wishes to voluntarily make supplemental disclosures related to the merger, all of which are set forth below, in response to certain of the allegations raised in the complaints described above.""

This reasoning aligns with the excerpts, which indicate that supplemental disclosures were made in response to the allegations raised in the lawsuits, confirming a ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly identified no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Rabinowitz case in the excerpts. This part of the reasoning is accurate.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM also correctly noted the absence of any formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution related to the Rabinowitz case, aligning with the task instructions.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No strong implication of an agreement related to the Rabinowitz case is found in the excerpts, and the LLM correctly acknowledges this.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreements were identified, step 6 is correctly noted as not applicable by the LLM.
