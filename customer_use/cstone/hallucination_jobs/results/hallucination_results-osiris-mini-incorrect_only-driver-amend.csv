"1. The name of the Corporation is ""Pensare Acquisition Corp."" The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the ""Secretary of State"") on April 7, 2016 (the ""Original Certificate"") under the name Pensare Technology Group, Inc. The first certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on May 16, 2016. The second certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on December 19, 2016, in which the name of the Corporation was changed from Pensare Technology Group, Inc. to Pensare Acquisition Corp. The third certificate of amendment of the Original Certificate was filed with the Secretary of State on May 11, 2017. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate""), was filed on July 27, 2017 which both restates and amends the provisions of the Original Certificate, as amended.

2. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and by the affirmative vote of the Corporation's stockholders in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ""DGCL"").

3. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the stockholders generally are entitled to vote.

(b) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders, and no holder of any series of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled to any voting powers in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including a Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of the Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and the Bylaws.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock -_Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), or by the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

Article XI
AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Pensare Acquisition Corp. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article XI, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is not explicitly stated in the excerpt. However, Article XI mentions that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate ""in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL"". This suggests that the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment may be specified in the DGCL or elsewhere in the Second Amended and Restated Certificate, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"" since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not explicitly stated.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not explicitly stated.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes (determined as of the record date of such consent) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states in Article XI that ""The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL;"". However, it does not specify the voting requirements for such amendments.

However, in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"", it is stated that ""all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI."" This implies that the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation is subject to certain rights and privileges of the stockholders, but it does not explicitly state the voting requirements.

However, in Section 7.3, it is stated that ""Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes (determined as of the record date of such consent) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted.""

Therefore, the answer to Q1 is ""Yes"".

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. However, it mentions that the consent in writing shall be signed by the holders of record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereat were present and voted.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not explicitly stated, it is not possible to determine whether it is a supermajority or not.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not explicitly stated, it is not possible to determine whether the supermajority requirement is applied only for a subset of articles or not.

(C) The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the GCL.

(1) Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation thereof, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issue of such series all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the GCL.

(4) Subject to applicable law, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"" because the excerpt states that ""The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute..."" and also provides specific voting requirements for certain amendments, such as increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"" because the excerpt states that ""any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class."" However, this percentage only applies to the removal of directors, not to all amendments of the Certificate of Incorporation. For other amendments, such as increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the required percentage is ""50"" (a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote).

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"" because the percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes, removal of directors"" because the supermajority requirement of 66.67% only applies to the removal of directors, not to all amendments of the Certificate of Incorporation.

The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity pursuant to Section 122(17) of the DGCL. An ""Excluded Opportunity"" is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of (a) any director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (b) any holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Covered Persons""), unless such matter, transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation, such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue, and to the extent the director is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal or contractual obligation. Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

AMENDMENT OF AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article X.

Section 11.1 Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, and except as otherwise set forth in the immediately following sentence, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the provisions of this Section 11.1 will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and (b) unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against the Corporation or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Monocle Holdings Inc. has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

[Signature Page to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states: ""The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate..."".

However, the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment. But it does mention that the amendment can be done ""in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL"". This implies that the amendment may require a vote of shareholders, but the specific percentage is not mentioned.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"", as the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"", as the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not mentioned.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"", as the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not mentioned, and therefore it is unclear whether a supermajority requirement applies to a subset of articles.

"2. The Corporation amended and restated the Original Certificate on February 27, 2019 (as amended and restated, the ""First Amended and Restated Certificate"").

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Second Amended and Restated Certificate""), which both restates and amends the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the ""DGCL"").

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

5. The text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended after the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.1 shall not apply to any action seeking to enforce any liability, obligation or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended).

If any provision or provisions (or any part thereof) of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (ii) the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

[Signature Page to Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is stated in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"" which mentions that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

However, upon re-reading the excerpt, I found a provision in Section 5.1 that mentions the Bylaws can be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. This provision implies that a majority vote is required to amend the Bylaws, but it does not explicitly state the percentage required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.

Additionally, I found another provision in Section 10.1 that mentions the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, but it does not relate to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation.

But then I found another provision in the section ""AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"" which mentions that the Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; 

However, the excerpt does not explicitly state the percentage of shareholders required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. But it does mention that the amendment can be done in the manner prescribed by the DGCL. 

According to the DGCL, a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation by obtaining the approval of its stockholders, which typically requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 

Therefore, I will update my previous answer as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". 

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""50"" or ""majority"". The excerpt states in Section 12.01 that no amendment may be made by the Board to change the percentage of stockholders required to pass a Resolution of Stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. Additionally, Section (b) states that in all other cases, a resolution approved at a duly convened and constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the shares entitled to vote thereon which were present at the meeting and were voted, or a resolution consented to in writing by holders of a majority of the votes of all the shares entitled to vote thereon.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"". The excerpt states that a majority of the votes of the shares entitled to vote thereon is required, which is 50%.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the answer to Q3 is ""No"", there is no supermajority requirement.

```",,FALSE,hallucination,"The LLM’s response shows a misinterpretation of the key requirement for Q1. The task asks whether there is a provision that requires a supermajority (i.e. more than 50%) vote to amend the Certificate. However, the excerpt only authorizes amendments by stockholders with a majority vote, and explicitly bars changing the required percentage by the Board. There is no language indicating a supermajority requirement; instead, it implies that a simple majority (50%) vote suffices. Despite that, the LLM answered ""Yes"" to Q1 and later justified a ""50"" vote requirement. This creates an internal contradiction: it asserts the existence of a supermajority provision but then states that only a majority vote is needed. As such, the response misinterprets the provided excerpt and diverges from the task instructions.

"2. This Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the certificate of incorporation of this corporation as heretofore amended and restated, has been duly adopted by the corporation in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL and has been adopted by the requisite vote of the stockholders of this corporation, acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.

3. The certificate of incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

1. Equal Status; General. Except as otherwise provided in this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended and/or restated from time to time, including pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation (as defined below), this ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights, privileges and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and be identical in all respects and as to all matters. The voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights, powers and preferences of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock of any series as may be designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") upon any issuance of the Preferred Stock of any series.

2. Voting. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, at all meetings of stockholders and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation generally, each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to one (1) vote per share of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall have the right to twenty (20) votes per share of Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall (a) at all times vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation generally, (b) be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (the ""Bylaws""), and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are exclusively entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series of Preferred Stock, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. There shall be no cumulative voting.

6.1 Merger or Consolidation. In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or any consideration into which such shares are converted, upon the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity, such distribution, payment or consideration that the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, shall be made ratably on a per share basis among the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as a single class; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate distribution, payment or consideration in connection with such consolidation, merger or other transaction in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of holders of shares of Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction having up to twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

6.2 Third-Party Tender or Exchange Offers. The Corporation may not enter into any agreement pursuant to which a third party may by tender or exchange offer acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock unless the holders of (a) the Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class B Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive, and (b) the Class B Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class A Common Stock would receive, or have the right to elect to receive; provided, however, that shares of such classes may receive, or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in connection with such tender or exchange offer in order to reflect the special rights, powers and privileges of the holders of shares of the Class B Common Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include, without limitation, securities exchangeable for each share of Class B Common Stock having up to twenty (20) times the voting power of any securities exchangeable for each share of Class A Common Stock) or such other rights, powers, privileges or other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

7.4 Policies and Procedures. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or the other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, relating to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, as it may deem necessary or advisable in connection therewith (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that this sentence shall not authorize or empower the Corporation to expand upon the events that constitute a Mandatory Class B Conversion Event). If the Corporation has reason to believe that a Transfer or other Conversion Event giving rise to a conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock has occurred but has not theretofore been reflected on the books of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation), the Corporation may request that the holder of such shares furnish affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as the Corporation deems necessary to determine whether a conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock has occurred, and if such holder does not within ten (10) days after the date of such request furnish sufficient evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the request) to enable the Corporation to determine that no such conversion has occurred, any such shares of Class B Common Stock, to the extent not previously converted, shall be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and the same shall thereupon be registered on the books and records of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation). In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a meeting, the stock ledger of the Corporation (or in book-entry as maintained by the transfer agent of the Corporation) shall be presumptive evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and the class or classes or series of shares held by each such stockholder and the number of shares of each class or classes or series held by such stockholder.

9. Protective Provisions. Unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, prior to the Final Conversion Date, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, certificate of designation or otherwise (i) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of Part A of this Article IV (or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith), or (ii) except for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and as provided in Section 10 below, authorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation entitling the holder thereof to more than (1) vote for each share thereof or entitling any class or series of securities to designate or elect directors as a class or series separate from the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

11. Definitions. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation:

""Effective Date"" means the date on which this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is first effective.

""Requisite Stockholder Consent"" means (i) prior to the Voting Threshold Date, the action at a meeting or by written consent (to the extent permitted under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would then be entitled to vote in the election of directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, and (ii) on and after the Voting Threshold Date, the action at a meeting or by written consent (to the extent permitted under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would then be entitled to vote in the election of directors at an annual meeting of stockholders.

(a) the granting of a revocable proxy to officers or directors of the Corporation at the request of the Board in connection with (i) actions to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or (ii) any other action of the stockholders permitted by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) nothing in the immediately preceding provisos shall limit the rights of the Board as specified in Article IV, Section B (as qualified by Article IV, Section 9) or Article VI of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Article V to the contrary, any amendment to a provision that contemplates a specific approval requirement by the stockholders (or any class of capital stock of the Corporation) in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the definition of Requisite Stockholder Consent and Voting Threshold Date) shall require the greater of (x) the specific approval requirement by the stockholders (or any class of capital stock of the Corporation) contemplated in such provision, and (y) the approval requirements contemplated by this Article V.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by the DGCL, and subject to the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any regular or special meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The stockholders may not adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith, unless such action is approved, in addition to any other vote required by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by the Requisite Stockholder Consent.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Court of Chancery (the ""Chancery Court"") of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any other wrongdoing by, any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation, (3) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of any provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article XIV, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action, suit or proceeding asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the applicable courts specified in the immediately preceding sentence (a ""Foreign Action"") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

If any provision or provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible and without limiting any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (or any other provision of the Bylaws or any agreement entered into by the Corporation), the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service to, or for the benefit of, the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, each and every Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest (of any nature whatsoever) in any shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed, by reason of and from and after the time of such purchase or other acquisition, to have notice of and to have consented to all of the provisions of (a) this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (b) the Bylaws and (c) any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws enacted or adopted in accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and applicable law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been executed this 16th day of December, 2020.

Signature Page to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 635,000,000 shares, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class A Common Stock""), 125,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Class B Common Stock""), and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Stock""). The number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below (i) the number of shares thereof then outstanding and (ii) with respect to the Class A Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock reserved pursuant to Section 8 of Part A of this Article IV) by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.","To answer the questions, I will go through them one by one.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII;""

Additionally, there are specific provisions that require a supermajority vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock, such as: ""so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directly or indirectly, whether by amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation...""

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

There are two different percentages mentioned:

* A majority of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, which is equivalent to 50%.
* Two-thirds (2/3rd) of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, which is equivalent to 66.67%.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

The answer is ""Yes"" for the 66.67% requirement, and ""No"" for the 50% requirement.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement of 66.67% applies to amendments that affect the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of the shares of Class B Common Stock, and also to amendments that are inconsistent with Articles IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII.

Note that the answers to Q2, Q3, and Q4 are not straightforward, as there are multiple provisions with different requirements.",,FALSE,hallucination,"The LLM’s answer shows problems in several areas. First, while Q1 is meant to be answered “Yes” only if a supermajority (i.e. higher than a simple majority) is required, the excerpt actually contains two different provisions: one requiring a simple majority (50%) for most amendments and a separate supermajority (two‐thirds or about 66.67%) for amendments that affect certain parts (e.g. those affecting Class B Common Stock or specific articles). The instructions require that if even one provision forces a supermajority vote to amend any part of the Certificate of Incorporation, the answer should be “Yes” for Q1, with Q2 reporting the specific supermajority percentage (typically 66.67%). Instead, the LLM’s answer lists two different percentages (50 and 66.67) without selecting the proper one and conflates requirements that are not equivalent. 

Furthermore, the answer introduces extra questions (such as a “Q3” asking whether the percentage is a supermajority and a “Q4” about subset of articles) that are not part of the original task instructions. The quoted text provided by the LLM comes from a section that governs a simple majority vote rather than the supermajority provision, which is misleading.

Thus, the LLM’s output diverges from the task instructions by including extraneous questions, misidentifying the correct supermajority requirement, and providing conflicting percentages. This constitutes a hallucination.

"SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

AMCI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the ""Corporation""), hereby certifies that this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ""DGCL""), and that:

B. The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2018; an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on November 15, 2018; a Certificate of Amendment to such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on May 19, 2019; and a further Certificate of Amendment to such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed on October 16, 2020 (as amended by such amendments, the ""Amended and Restated Certificate"").

C. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation amends and restates the Amended and Restated Certificate.

D. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

(c) Voting. Each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote; provided, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, but not limited to, any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, but not limited to, any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

(d) No Class Vote On Changes In Authorized Number of Shares Of Preferred Stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any certificate of designations or any resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series of stock adopted by the Board of Directors, the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

(b) Classified Board of Directors. Subject to the special right of the holders of any class or series of stock to elect directors, the Board of Directors shall be classified with respect to the time for which directors severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. The initial Class I Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; the initial Class II Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; and the initial Class III Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Each director in each class shall hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in the third year following the year of their election, with each director in each such class to hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

(a) Limitation of Director Liability. To the fullest extent that the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware (as they exist on the date hereof or as they may hereafter be amended) permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to, or modification or repeal of, this Article VI shall adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

(a) No Action by Written Consent. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation may be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.

To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law and unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (an ""Alternative Forum Consent""), the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (each, as in effect from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, in the event that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation gives an Alternative Forum Consent, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article VIII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Any person or entity purchasing, otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VIII.

ARTICLE IX -- AMENDMENTS TO THE

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be executed by the officer below this 4th day of February, 2021.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the power of the stockholders of the Corporation to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, that with respect to the powers of stockholders to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to make, alter amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is found in Article IX, which states that the affirmative vote of holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"". This is explicitly stated in Article IX.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". The required percentage of 66.67% is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""No"". The supermajority requirement applies to the Bylaws of the Corporation in general, and not to a specific subset of articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

"11.1 | The General Meeting may resolve to reduce the issued share capital by cancelling Shares or by reducing the nominal value of Shares by an amendment of the Articles of Association.

18.5 | The General Meeting may at all times overrule the binding nature of each nomination by a resolution adopted by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast, representing more than half of the issued share capital.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is stated in Article 40, which authorizes the General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is not explicitly stated as a percentage, but it is mentioned that a resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a proposal from the Board and a mention in the notice of the General Meeting. However, in Article 18.5, it is mentioned that the General Meeting may overrule the binding nature of each nomination by a resolution adopted by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast, representing more than half of the issued share capital. This implies that a two-thirds majority is required for certain amendments.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". A two-thirds majority is indeed a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"". The supermajority requirement is applied to the amendment of Article 25, as stated in Article 25.6, and to the overruling of the binding nature of each nomination, as stated in Article 18.5.

}
```

Note that the quote provided is not directly related to the supermajority requirement, but it is a relevant sentence that supports the answer to Question 1.",,FALSE,hallucination,"Here is the detailed analysis:

Step 1: The LLM was to decide if there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote for amending the Certificate of Incorporation (or Articles of Association, as appears in the excerpts). The excerpts show several articles (Article 40 and related clauses) that authorize amendments but do not specify any vote threshold greater than a simple majority. An article mentioning a two‐thirds requirement (Article 18.5) is present; however, it relates to overruling the binding nature of nominations rather than to amending the Articles.

Step 2: Q1 asks whether a supermajority is required for amendments. The proper determination from the excerpts is that no explicit supermajority vote is required in the amendment provisions (Articles 40, 40.1–40.3 do not include a threshold). The only explicit supermajority language (66.67% in Article 18.5) is tied to a different matter entirely. The LLM incorrectly answered “Yes” by attributing supermajority language to Article 40.

Step 3: For Q2 it then extracts “66.67%” as the required percentage when in reality the excerpt does not support a supermajority requirement for amending; the two‐thirds standard in the excerpts applies to a nomination overruling provision, not to amendments of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Step 4: For Q3 the response does not correctly provide the amendment language supporting an answer of “No” when there is no supermajority provision, instead the LLM’s Q3 answer is related to an agreement that does not match the instructions for Q3.

Conclusion: The LLM’s response diverges from the instructions by misinterpreting the excerpts. It hallucinates a supermajority amendment provision in Article 40 and misapplies the two-thirds requirement from a different context.

{
    ""analysis"": ""The LLM incorrectly identified a supermajority requirement in the amendment provisions by attributing the two-thirds threshold from Article 18.5 (which concerns overruling nominations) to Article 40 (which authorizes amendments without specifying a supermajority).

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states that the General Meeting of Shareholders has the power to ""adopt and amend the Articles of Association"" (Artikel 7: Befugnisse).

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". The excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage is not specified, it is not possible to determine if the supermajority requirement applies to a subset of articles.

Here is the JSON object summarizing the answers:

It answered 'Yes' to the existence of a supermajority requirement by citing the phrase 'Festsetzung und Änderung der Statuten;'. However, the excerpt merely states that the General Meeting has the power to adopt and amend the Articles of Association and does not specify any supermajority vote or percentage threshold. As a result, the LLM incorrectly classified the provision and, by extension, misinterpreted the amendment requirements. This constitutes a hallucination."",

· | ""Articles of Association"" are to the amended and restated articles of association of ARYA;

· | to provide that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement;

· | Governing Documents Proposal C--to provide that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement.

Based on the assumptions discussed in ""Business Combination Proposal--Ownership of New Cerevel,"" upon the completion of the Business Combination, the Bain Investor and Pfizer, will own, collectively, approximately 68.57% of the outstanding New Cerevel Common Stock, assuming that none of ARYA's outstanding public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination or approximately 77.69% of the outstanding New Cerevel Common Stock, assuming that, without giving effect to the ARYA Shareholder Transaction Support Agreements entered into by certain public shareholders participating in the PIPE Financing, all of ARYA's outstanding public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination. Furthermore, as discussed under ""Business Combination Proposal--Related Agreements--Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement,"" so long as they own certain specified amounts of its equity securities, Bain Investor and Pfizer have certain rights to nominate New Cerevel's directors. As long as such persons each own or control a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, Bain Investor and Pfizer will have the right to designate directors pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights agreement. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the price at which shares are being sold in this transaction and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling the company to an acquirer than other investors or they may want Cerevel to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.

The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income, net of income taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.

GOVERNING DOCUMENTS PROPOSAL C--APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL REGARDING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION BEING SUBJECT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED REGISTRATION AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This amendment would indicate that the terms of New Cerevel's certificate of incorporation are subject to the terms of Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement when such terms are in conflict.

These provisions are intended to ensure that the terms of New Cerevel's certificate of incorporation do not conflict with the rights granted under the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement. See ""Business Combination Proposal--Related Agreements--Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement.""

""RESOLVED, as a special resolution, that the provision that certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of New Cerevel are subject to the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement be approved.""

Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company's memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The Existing Governing Documents provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We will enter into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We expect to purchase a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.

Voting rights. Each holder of New Cerevel Common Stock will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of New Cerevel Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters voted upon by our stockholders, provided, however, that, except as otherwise required in the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the holders of New Cerevel Common Stock will not be entitled to vote on any amendment to our Proposed Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to our Proposed Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

Dividend rights. Subject to any other provisions of the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, holders of shares of New Cerevel Common Stock will be entitled to receive ratably, in proportion to the number of shares of New Cerevel Common Stock held by them, such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of New Cerevel when, as and if declared thereon by the New Cerevel Board from time to time out of assets or funds of New Cerevel legally available therefor.

Subject to the rights, if any, of any series of New Cerevel Preferred Stock, any director may be removed from office only with cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock (as defined below) of New Cerevel then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Any such director proposed to be removed from office is entitled to advance written notice as described in the Proposed Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, in case the New Cerevel Board or any one or more directors should be so removed, new directors may be elected at the same time for the unexpired portion of the full term of the director or directors so removed.

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on amendments to a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws is required to approve such amendment, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage.

The Proposed Certificate of Incorporation will provide that the following provisions therein may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class:

The Company will provide the holders (the ""Public Shareholders"") of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the ""Public Shares""), with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity."" In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which the Company will adopt upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the ""Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association""), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company's legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, private placement shares (the ""Private Placement Shares"") underlying the Private Placement Units and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of its Business Combination and does not conduct redemptions in connection with its Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a ""group"" (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company.

The Company's Sponsor, officers and directors (the ""initial shareholders"") have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to provide holders of its Public Shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Company's Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or June 9, 2022 (the ""Combination Period"") or with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

The Company will provide the holders (the ""Public Shareholders"") of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the ""Public Shares""), with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 480 ""Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity."" In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant information.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer to Q1 is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""The Proposed Certificate of Incorporation will provide that the following provisions therein may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class:""

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer to Q2 is ""66.67"". The excerpt states: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then outstanding shares of New Cerevel's stock entitled to vote thereon""

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer to Q3 is ""Yes"". Since 66.67% is greater than 50%, it is a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer to Q4 is ""No"". The excerpt does not specify that the supermajority requirement only applies to a subset of articles.

"Amendment No. 1 provides that, following the First Effective Time, the total number of Deferred Shares that the Sponsor may receive upon the occurrence of certain events under the Business Combination Agreement is increased from 4,000,000 Deferred Shares to 4,200,000 Deferred Shares. As a result, at the closing of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will receive 5.8 million shares of New Parent Common Stock, 1.0 million of which will be forfeited. Amendment No.1 further provides that if holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (""Holders"") are issued Bonus Shares (as defined and further described below) pursuant to Section 5.3(e) of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as defined below) (i) in an aggregate amount in excess of 1,000,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP (as defined and further described below) of $13.00 to $15.99, (ii) in an aggregate amount in excess of 750,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP of $16.00 to $16.99, or (iii) in an aggregate amount in excess of 500,000 shares in respect of a 30-Day VWAP of $17.00 to $17.99 (such excess shares, the ""Excess Bonus Shares"") then the number of Deferred Shares to be released to the Sponsor will be reduced by the number of Excess Bonus Shares issued. Upon the occurrence of any event that precludes all or a portion of the Excess Bonus Shares from being issued (a ""Bonus Share Release Event""), New Parent will issue to the Sponsor an aggregate number of Deferred Shares equal to the number of Excess Bonus Shares that are no longer issuable as a result of such Bonus Share Release Event.

New Parent has revised the form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to become effective as of the Second Effective Time (the ""Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation""), which is attached hereto as Appendix D, to reflect the proposed issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Pursuant to the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Holders will be entitled to receive, when, if, and as declared by the board of directors of New Parent, cumulative dividends at the Dividend Rate per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, paid or accrued quarterly in arrears. Such Dividend Rate (as further described in the Updated Amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation) is equal to 5.75% of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference (as defined below). If New Parent fails to pay a dividend for any quarter on a dividend payment date in arrears in cash at the then-prevailing Dividend Rate, then for purposes of calculating the accrual of unpaid dividends for such quarter then ended, dividends will be calculated to have accrued at the then-prevailing Dividend Rate plus 300 basis points (other than for the first quarter in which New Parent fails to pay the dividend in cash on the applicable payment date, which shall accrue at 5.75% per annum). The Dividend Rate will, in no event, exceed an annual rate of 14.50%, and will revert to 5.75% upon New Parent paying in cash all then-accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If New Parent breaches any of the protective provisions set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or fails to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon the proper exercise of any redemption right by the Holders, the Dividend Rate will increased to an annual rate of 15.00% for so long as such breach or failure to redeem remains in effect.

If New Parent undergoes a Change of Control (as defined in the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation including, among other things, certain change-in-control transactions, asset sales, or liquidation events), each Holder, at such Holder's election, may require New Parent to purchase (a ""Change of Control Put"") all or a portion of such Holder's shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that have not been converted, at a purchase price per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, payable in cash, equal to the greater of (A) the sum of (x) the product of 101% multiplied by $100.00 per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, adjusted for any Recapitalization Event (the ""Original Issue Price""), plus (y) all accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of such share as of the effective date of the Change of Control or (B) the amount payable in respect of such share in such Change of Control if such share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Change of Control (in each case, the ""Change of Control Price""); provided that New Parent will only be required to pay the Change of Control Price to the extent such purchase can be made out of funds legally available therefor. New Parent will pay the Change of Control Price not later than 30 days after the effective date of the Change of Control.

New Parent will not be permitted to issue any shares of preferred stock that rank senior to, or pari passu with, such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock without the consent or affirmative vote of the Holders a majority of the then outstanding shares of such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, New Parent will not be permitted to incur indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness results in the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2020, by and among GPM Investments, LLC, the lenders signatory thereto, the guarantors signatory thereto, and Ares Capital Corporation, as administrative agent for the lenders, as amended, which is attached as Exhibit 10.16 to New Parent's registration statement on Form S-4) being greater than 7:00:1:00. New Parent will also not be permitted to amend, alter, repeal, or waive, (either directly or indirectly by merger, consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the Updated Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or its bylaws, if such action would adversely and materially alter the rights, preferences, privileges, or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit to, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transaction, the Subscribers desire to subscribe for and purchase from the Company, and the Company desires to issue and sell to the Subscribers (i) an aggregate of 700,000 shares (the ""Firm Shares"") of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Preferred Shares""), with the terms set forth in the form of amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company attached as Exhibit A hereto (as amended, restated, and/or otherwise modified in accordance with its terms, the ""Charter""), and (ii) up to an aggregate of an additional 300,000 Preferred Shares if and to the extent that the Company exercises the right granted to it in Section 1 of this Subscription Agreement (the ""Additional Shares"" and together with the Firm Shares, the ""Acquired Securities""), in each case for a purchase price of $100 per share (the ""Purchase Price"").

6. Amendment to Exhibit B of the Agreement (Amended and Restated Parentco Certificate of Incorporation). Exhibit B to the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

2. This Restated Certificate restates, integrates, and amends the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in its entirety, as set forth in Exhibit A (this ""Restated Certificate"").

AMENDMENT OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in ARTICLE IX, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this ARTICLE XI.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law, by this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), or by the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(a) General. Subject to Section 5.4(c), except as set forth herein or as required by applicable law, the Holders and the holders of Common Stock shall vote as a single class on an as-converted basis. Each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock then held. Subject to Section 5.4(c), each Holder shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder would be converted as of the record date, without giving effect to any limitations on conversion by the Holder set forth in Section 5.3(g). Subject to Section 5.4(c), the Holders shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Corporation's bylaws, as amended and/or restated from time to time (the ""Bylaws""). Except as set forth herein or as required by applicable law, there shall be no series voting. Fractional votes shall not be permitted, and any fractional voting rights shall be disregarded.

(b) Authorized Shares of Common Stock. Subject to Section 5.3(d)(viii), the number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes represented by all then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

Section 6.5. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ARTICLE VI, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this ARTICLE VI unless expressly provided by such terms.

Except as required by Delaware law, Holders and holders of New Parent Common Stock will vote as a single class on an as-converted basis. Each Holder will be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of New Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder would be converted as of the record date. However, except as required by applicable law, Holders will not be entitled to vote on any matter presented to the holders of New Parent Common Stock for their action or consideration unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide written notification to New Parent that such Holders are electing, on behalf of all Holders, to activate their voting rights. Holders will be and continue to be entitled to vote their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock unless and until holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide further written notice to New Parent that they are electing to deactivate their voting rights.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt states: ""AMENDMENT OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE... The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate... in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Restated Certificate and the DGCL;""

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but there are specific provisions that require a majority vote of the holders of a particular class or series of stock. For example, Section 5.4(c) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.

However, there is a specific provision that requires a supermajority vote: ""the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes represented by all then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL"" is required to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. But this is not a supermajority vote for amending the Certificate of Incorporation.

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but ""Yes"" for specific provisions.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" for the Certificate of Incorporation as a whole, but ""Yes"" for specific provisions. For example, the provision that requires a majority vote of the holders of a particular class or series of stock is only applied to certain matters, such as the election of directors or the adoption, amendment, alteration or repeal of the Bylaws.

For example, the LLM first asserts that there is a provision requiring a supermajority vote by quoting a segment from the “AMENDMENT OF RESTATED CERTIFICATE” section, yet this language does not support a supermajority requirement for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. In fact, the excerpt does not specify any percentage greater than a simple majority (50%) for amendment, and it does not reference any numeric threshold (such as 66.67% or another supermajority percentage) for such amendments. 

Furthermore, the response provides three different JSON objects with conflicting answers regarding the existence of supermajority requirements, the percentage required, and whether the supermajority requirement applies only to a subset of articles.

Clause 12.1 states that the Company may amend the Memorandum or the Articles by Resolution of Shareholders or by Resolution of Directors, subject to certain exceptions. However, Clause 12.2 provides that the provisions of Regulation 23 of the Articles may only be amended with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the attending and voting holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.

Step-by-step, the LLM response misinterprets the instructions regarding what qualifies as a supermajority vote. The instructions define a supermajority as a requirement over a simple majority (typically 66 2/3% or similar thresholds). The excerpt provided, however, states that an amendment requires the vote of at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, which is simply a majority. Therefore, the correct response should indicate ""No"" to the existence of a supermajority requirement. Instead, the LLM incorrectly answered ""Yes"" while also specifying ""50"" as the percentage, and then indicated in Q3 that the 50% is not a supermajority—this is contradictory and misaligned with the task instructions. There is a hallucination in misclassifying a 50% threshold as a supermajority provision.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (""Bylaws"") of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Thereafter, the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board of Directors then in office.

Section 4.2 Preferred Stock. The board of directors of the Corporation (the ""Board"") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the unissued shares of the Preferred Stock for one or more series of Preferred Stock and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included in a certificate of designation (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") filed pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any such resolution or resolutions. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.","I will go through the questions one by one.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article X, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the entire Certificate of Incorporation, but there is a specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. However, this is not a general provision for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, I will answer ""NA"" for the general provision, but note that there is a specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock that requires a majority vote.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"" because the general provision for amending the Certificate of Incorporation does not specify a percentage. However, the specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock requires a majority vote, which is not a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" because there is no general supermajority requirement for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. However, the specific provision for amending the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock requires a majority vote, and this provision only applies to the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, the initial adoption of any certificate of designations that establishes, or authorizes the issuance of, any series of Preferred Stock.

iii. At any time when there are no longer any shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, this Certificate automatically shall be deemed amended to delete this Section 4.03(b) in its entirety and replaced with ""intentionally omitted"".

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

Section 5.01. Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the Bylaws.

Section 5.04. Removal. Subject to Section 5.05, and except as otherwise required by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Section 5.05. Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any certificate of designations with respect to any series of Preferred Stock and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders upon obtaining (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, and (ii) any other vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, by any Preferred Stock Designation or the Bylaws; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.03. Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation.

Section 8.01. Limitation of Director and Officer Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence, or any adoption, amendment, modification or repeal of any other provision of this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with the foregoing sentence, shall not reduce, eliminate or adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such adoption, amendment, modification or repeal.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.02 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.02 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.02, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE IX. AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or any Preferred Stock Designation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and notwithstanding that a lesser percentage may be permitted from time to time by applicable law, no provision of Article V, Article VII, Article VIII, this Article IX and Article XI may be altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision or bylaw inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless, in addition to any other vote required by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or otherwise required by law, such alternation, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

Section 10.01. Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder's counsel, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction or (D) any action arising under the federal securities laws, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction.

To the fullest extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the DGCL, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities, which are from time to time presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of Highland Capital Partners 9 Limited Partnership, Highland Capital Partners 9-B Limited Partnership or Highland Entrepreneurs' Fund 9 Limited Patrnership, or any of their managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries), even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person or entity shall be liable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or entity or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer of the Corporation, such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article XI, nor the adoption, alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article XI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article XI in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article XI, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Insurance Acquisition Corp. has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth hereinabove.

[Signature Page to Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. Specifically, Article IX states that certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation can only be altered, amended, or repealed with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is a majority, which is 50%.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

No, the percentage required is not a supermajority, as it is a simple majority of 50%.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

NA, as there is no supermajority requirement.

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

5. The text of the Existing Certificate, as heretofore amended and supplemented, is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Section 4.4 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Certificate of Designations of the Series A Shares was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 29, 2020. The provisions of the resolutions set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as amended and restated hereby, are incorporated herein as Section 4.4 of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. The designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights of the Series A Shares shall be as follows:

(10) Noncircumvention. The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Second Amended and Restated Certificate, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Section 4.4, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Section 4.4 and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Section 4.4 or the other Transaction Documents, the Corporation (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Series A Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Series A Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Series A Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Series A Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein).

(18) Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Series A Shares. In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate, without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, the Corporation shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, its Second Amended and Restated Certificate or Bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit, of the Series A Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Series A Shares; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(2), create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Series A Shares with respect to dividends or the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of capital stock of the Corporation junior in rank to the Series A Shares (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements (that have in good faith been approved by the Board) with employees giving the Corporation the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(2), pay dividends or make any other distribution on any shares of any capital stock of the Corporation junior in rank to the Series A Shares; (f) issue any Series A Shares other than pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 4.4(9), whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Series A Shares, circumvent a right of the Series A Shares.

(a) Stockholder Matters. Any stockholder action, approval or consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Corporation pursuant to the DGCL, the Second Amended and Restated Certificate or otherwise with respect to the issuance of Series A Shares may be effected by written consent of the Corporation's stockholders or at a duly called meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the DGCL. This provision is intended to comply with the applicable sections of the DGCL permitting stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

(b) Amendment. This Section 4.4 or any provision hereof may be amended by obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the DGCL, of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, and with such other stockholder approval, if any, as may then be required pursuant to the DGCL and the Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into two classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I and Class II. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I or Class II. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a two-year term. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Action by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holder of the Class C Special Voting Share and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The provision is found in ARTICLE X, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"". Although there is a provision that requires a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation, the excerpt does not specify the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

However, in Section 4.4, subsection (b), it is mentioned that the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the DGCL, of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, is required to amend this Section 4.4 or any provision hereof. But the percentage of Required Holders is not specified.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not specified, it is not possible to determine if it is a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"". Since the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment is not specified, it is not possible to determine if the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock or other series of Common Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, are entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

The foregoing conversion ratio shall also be adjusted to account for any subdivision (by stock split, subdivision, exchange, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split, exchange, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or similar reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares occurring after the original filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate without a proportionate and corresponding subdivision, combination or similar reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class F Common Stock.

(iii) Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), for so long as any shares of Class F Common Stock shall remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class F Common Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or special rights of the Class F Common Stock. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of Class F Common Stock may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding Class F Common Stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Class F Common Stock were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt written notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the holders of Class F Common Stock shall, to the extent required by law, be given to those holders of Class F Common Stock who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders of Class F Common Stock to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (""Bylaws""), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, the Board shall be divided into two classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I and Class II. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I or Class II. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a two-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL. The Class I directors shall be Darryl T. F. McCall, Rahul Petkar, and Ann M. Schwister, with their successors to be elected and appointed at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the year ended 2020. The Class II directors shall be Edwin J. Rigaud, Richard White, Aditya Jha, and Prashant Pathak, with their successors to be elected and appointed at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the year ended 2021.

Section 5.5 Preferred Stock - Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this Article V unless expressly provided by such terms.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 7.3 Prohibition on Actions by Written Consent. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(a) The provisions of this Article IX shall apply during the period commencing upon the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and terminating upon the consummation of the Corporation's initial Business Combination and no amendment to this Article IX shall be effective prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.

(b) Immediately after the Offering, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds received by the Corporation in the Offering (including the proceeds of any exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option) and certain other amounts specified in the Corporation's registration statement on Form S-1, as initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2017, as amended (the ""Registration Statement""), shall be deposited in a trust account (the ""Trust Account""), established for the benefit of the Public Stockholders (as defined below) pursuant to a trust agreement described in the Registration Statement. Except for the withdrawal of interest of up to $750,000 per annum to fund working capital requirements and to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account (including the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) will be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of the Offering Shares (as defined below) if the Corporation is unable to complete its initial Business Combination by November 20, 2020 and (iii) the redemption of shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend any provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate relating to stockholders' rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity (as described in Section 9.7). Holders of shares of Common Stock included as part of the units sold in the Offering (the ""Offering Shares"") (whether such Offering Shares were purchased in the Offering or in the secondary market following the Offering and whether or not such holders are affiliates of Legacy Acquisition Sponsor I LLC (the ""Sponsor"") or officers or directors of the Corporation) are referred to herein as ""Public Stockholders.""

(a) Prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall provide all holders of Offering Shares with the opportunity to have their Offering Shares redeemed upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) (such rights of such holders to have their Offering Shares redeemed pursuant to such Sections, the ""Redemption Rights"") hereof for cash equal to the applicable redemption price per share determined in accordance with Section 9.2(b) hereof (the ""Redemption Price""); provided, however, that the Corporation shall not redeem Offering Shares to the extent that such redemption would result in the Corporation's failure to have net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") (or any successor rule)) in excess of $5 million or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to the initial Business Combination upon consummation of the initial Business Combination (such limitation hereinafter called the ""Redemption Limitation""). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, there shall be no Redemption Rights or liquidating distributions with respect to any warrant issued pursuant to the Offering.

Section 9.4 Share Issuances. Prior to the consummation of the Corporation's initial Business Combination, the Corporation shall not issue any additional shares of capital stock of the Corporation that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the Trust Account or vote on any initial Business Combination, on any pre-Business Combination activity or on any amendment to this Article IX

Section 9.7 Additional Redemption Rights. If, in accordance with Section 9.1(a), any amendment is made to this Article IX, the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any such amendment, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Corporation of up to $750,000 to fund working capital requirements and pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares, provided, however, that any such amendment will be voided, and this Article IX will remain unchanged, if any stockholders who wish to redeem are unable to redeem due to the Redemption Limitation.

AMENDMENT OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article XI; provided, however, that Article IX of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate may be amended only as provided therein.

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

If any provision or provisions (or any part thereof) of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (ii) the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in respect of their faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be duly executed on the date first set forth above.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

**Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?**

Yes, there are several provisions that require a vote of stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it. For example, Article IX can be amended only as provided therein, and Section 9.7 provides that the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any amendment to Article IX. Additionally, Article XI states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, subject to certain conditions.

**Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?**

The percentage of shareholders required for the amendment varies depending on the specific provision being amended. For example, Article IX can be amended only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock. Section 9.7 provides that the Public Stockholders shall be provided with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon the approval of any amendment to Article IX, but it does not specify a specific percentage of shareholders required for the amendment.

**Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?**

Yes, the percentage required to amend Article IX is a supermajority, specifically sixty-five percent (65%) of all then outstanding shares of the Common Stock.

**Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?**

Yes, the supermajority requirement is only applied to Article IX.

Q1: Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The excerpt mentions several provisions that require a vote of shareholders to amend or repeal certain articles or provisions, such as Article 5.5, Article 53.1, and Article 239.

Q2: If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""66.67"" (two-thirds). This is mentioned in Article 239, which requires the affirmative vote of members holding not less than two-thirds of the paid-up ordinary share capital of the Company for certain Business Transactions.

Q3: Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""Yes"". A two-thirds majority is indeed a supermajority.

Q4: Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""Yes"", the supermajority requirement is only applied for a subset of articles, specifically Business Transactions (as defined in Article 241.3) with or proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Person (as defined in Article 241.6) or any Affiliate (as defined in Article 241.1) of any Interested Person.

6. This Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with Secretary of State of Delaware.

7. The text of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) Voting. Except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation. Except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law or this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders.

Section 5.1 Board Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. The total number of directors shall be determined from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Subject to any rights granted to holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock , any newly-created directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors (whether by death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause) may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director or by the stockholders. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (the ""Bylaws"") of the Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 10.1 Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporation's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time); (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or (v) any action asserting an ""internal corporate claim"" as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL, shall be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.1 shall not apply to any action or proceeding asserting a claim under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Section 10.4 If any provision or provisions in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision or provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the application of such provision or provisions to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

ARTICLE XI
AMENDMENT OF FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, add or repeal any provision contained in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and except as set forth in ARTICLE VIII, all rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Live Oak Acquisition Corp. has caused this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

[Signature page to Live Oak Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate]

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter, change, add or repeal the Bylaws , without any action on the part of the stockholders, by the vote of at least a majority of the directors of the Corporation then in office. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class.","To answer the questions, I will go through the excerpt and identify the relevant provisions.

The excerpt is a Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of a company. It outlines the company's structure, powers, and procedures for amending the certificate.

For Question 1, I found a provision in ARTICLE XI that states the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, add or repeal any provision contained in this Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate. However, this provision does not explicitly state that a vote of shareholders is required to amend the Certificate. But later on, I found a provision that states ""The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class."" Although this provision is related to Bylaws, it implies that a similar provision might exist for the Certificate of Incorporation. However, I did not find an explicit statement that requires a vote of shareholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation. Therefore, I will answer Question 1 as ""Unsure"".

Since Question 1's answer is not ""Yes"", I will answer Questions 2, 3, and 4 as ""NA"".

```",,FALSE,hallucination,"The LLM response shows issues. It conflates provisions regarding bylaw amendments with provisions for amending the Certificate of Incorporation. The only voting threshold language present in the excerpt is for the Bylaws – where it states that bylaw amendments require the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power. There is no similar supermajority requirement specified in the section governing amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation (Article XI). As a result, in answering Q1 the correct response should be “No” (or, for Q3, the exact language supporting a majority-based amendment), rather than “Unsure.” The LLM’s answer thereby invents uncertainty by implying that the certificate might require a supermajority even though the excerpt provides no such indication. This constitutes a hallucination because the LLM misinterprets and misattributes the bylaw voting provision as pertaining to certificate amendments.

"2. This First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this ""Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation"") restates and amends the Original Certificate of Incorporation;

3. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 103, 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (""DGCL""); and

4. The text of the Original Certificate of Incorporation is hereby amended and restated to read, in full, as follows:

(a) The holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including a Preferred Stock Designation), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation.)

Fifth: The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C. The number of directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible. The initial term of office for the directors in Class A shall expire at the first Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; the initial term of office for the directors in Class B shall expire at the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; and the initial term of office for the directors in Class C shall expire at the third Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected to hold office for a three-year term and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office. Except as the DGCL may otherwise require and subject to the then-applicable terms of the Stockholders' Agreement, among the Corporation and certain of its stockholders, dated as of August 21, 2020, as it may be amended, restated, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, in the interim between Annual Meetings of Stockholders or Special Meetings of Stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more directors and the filling of any vacancy in that connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of Directors, including unfilled vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, although less than a quorum (as defined in the Corporation's bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of their respective terms of office or, if earlier, their respective death, resignation or removal and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. In case of any increase or decrease, from time to time, in the number of directors, the number of directors in each class shall be apportioned as nearly equal as possible. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office, or those filling vacancies resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, to Class A, Class B, or Class C, with such assignment to become effective, with respect to members of the Board of Directors already in office, as of the initial effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and, with respect to members filling vacancies resulting from an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, upon such appointment or election, as applicable.

A. Except as otherwise required by the DGCL or as provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

D. Except as may be otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders; provided, however, that prior to the first date on which the Sponsor Group (as defined herein) and their respective successors and Affiliates (as defined herein) cease collectively to have beneficial ownership (directly or indirectly) of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation that is approved in advance by the Board may be effected without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote of stockholders, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is or are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. The term ""beneficial ownership"" shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Eighth: A. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, and to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders in such capacity, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Corporation's bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

Tenth : The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in Article SEVENTH, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this Article TENTH.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by an authorized officer this 21st day of August, 2020.

First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation]

B. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series (a ""Preferred Stock Designation"") and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation.","Based on the provided excerpt, I will answer the questions as follows:

1. Is there a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation that requires a vote of a stockholders to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or certain sections of it?

The answer is ""Yes"". The relevant provision is in Article Tenth, which states that the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

2. If question 1's answer is ""Yes"", what is the percentage of shareholders required for the amendment?

The answer is ""NA"" for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. However, for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, the required percentage is ""50"" (a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors).

3. Is this percentage a supermajority (i.e. > 50%)?

The answer is ""No"" for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, as it requires a simple majority. However, for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, the answer is ""NA"" as no specific percentage is mentioned.

4. Is the supermajority requirement only applied for a subset of articles, and if so what is the subset of articles?

The answer is ""NA"" for the general amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. However, for the amendment of the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, the answer is ""No"" as it applies to all outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation.
