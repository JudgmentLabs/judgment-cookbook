<target_case>
- **case number**: 3:19-cv-00377
- **case name**: Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-02-26
- **case count**: United States District Court for the Southern District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""Five complaints, captioned Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377 (filed February 26, 2019), Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395 (filed February 26, 2019), Joel Rosenfeld IRA v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al,. Case No. 3:19-cv-00413 (filed March 1, 2019), Franck Prissert v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00429 (filed March 4, 2019) and Jonathan Mantak v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et. al, Case No. 3:19-cv-00451 (filed March 7, 2019) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.""

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure:

""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:""

This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine whether an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. However, since the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case, I will assume that it is associated with the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled 'Stockholder Approval Not Required,' which new subsection is entitled 'Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation' and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""The identified supplemental disclosure was not explicitly stated to be in response to the Target Case, but it was mentioned in the context of the lawsuits, including the Target Case.""
}
```",X1Q6O2LOGKO2,FALSE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies the Target Case, ""Kip Leggett v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00377,"" within the filing excerpts. The case is explicitly mentioned among several other lawsuits, confirming the discussion of the Target Case in the document.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task instructions specify that the supplemental disclosure must be explicitly mentioned as being in response to a lawsuit to affirm ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure. The LLM points to an amendment in Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9, adding a subsection titled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation."" However, the LLM assumes the disclosure is in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case, due to the context rather than explicit confirmation. The text does not directly connect the supplemental disclosure as a response to the Target Case or any specific lawsuit; it merely updates the section on litigation. This assumption constitutes a misinterpretation since there's no explicit mention linking the disclosure specifically to the lawsuit response.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly finds no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the excerpts provided.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM accurately identifies that the filing excerpts do not mention any formal agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM properly determines no strong implication of an agreement from the filing excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable, which the LLM correctly notes.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM does not entirely align with the instructions regarding the supplemental disclosure. The response assumes supplemental disclosure is related to the Target Case without explicit connection, deviating from the defined criteria. Thus, it incorrectly concludes ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure. The decision that there was no explicit or implied agreement is correct.

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding a subsection immediately following the subsection entitled ""Stockholder Approval Not Required,"" which new subsection is entitled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation"" and under such subsection, adding the following paragraphs:""

}",X1Q6O2M4GDO2,FALSE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Shiva Stein v. Maxwell Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00395,"" is mentioned in the filing excerpts. This confirmation is accurate as the case is listed among other lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM identifies that Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 was amended and supplemented with a new subsection titled ""Legal Proceedings - Stockholder Litigation."" However, the task instructions specify that for an answer of ""Yes,"" the supplemental disclosure must be explicitly made in response to the lawsuit. Here, the LLM claims supplemental disclosure but then states, ""it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case."" This admission means that the criteria for answering ""Yes"" according to the task instructions have not been met. The supplemental disclosure's association with the Target Case is not explicitly established, which should lead to a ""No"" answer for ""supplemental_disclosure.""

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM accurately notes that there is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" concerning the Target Case in the filing excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no mention of any other formal agreement regarding the Target Case in the filing excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM correctly states that there is no strong implication of an agreement in the textual data provided.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes with a ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure,"" despite acknowledging that no explicit connection to the Target Case was provided. Since the task instructions require explicit linkage for a ""Yes,"" the appropriate answer should have been ""No."" The LLM's conclusion about the absence of agreements is correct.

**Final Analysis:**

The LLM hallucinated by asserting a ""Yes"" for the ""supplemental_disclosure"" without explicit evidence connecting it to the Target Case. According to the task instructions, since that explicit linkage is necessary, the supplemental disclosure should have been marked as ""No.""

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the disclosures underlined below immediately after the first paragraph and before the second paragraph on page 70 of the Definitive Proxy Statement:

On March 18, 2019, Christopher Beveridge, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (""New York District Court""), captioned Christopher Beveridge v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-02390. The complaint filed by Christopher Beveridge (the ""Beveridge Complaint"") alleges that Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78(n)(a), 78(t)(a) respectively, Rule 14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. §240.14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly contains materially incomplete and misleading information about the Merger. Christopher Beveridge has asked the New York District Court to, among other things,(i) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with the special meeting of Ellie Mae's stockholders to vote on the proposed transaction or consummating the proposed transaction, unless and until Ellie Mae discloses the material information that the Beveridge Complaint alleges has been omitted from the Proxy Statement, (ii) direct the defendants to account to plaintiff for all damages sustained as a result of their wrongdoing, and (iii) award plaintiff the costs and disbursement of the action, including reasonable allowance for plaintiff's attorneys' and experts' fees.

On March 18, 2019, Michelle Stevens, a purported stockholder of Ellie Mae, filed a putative class action complaint against Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors in the California District Court, captioned Michael Stevens v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-01414. The complaint filed by Michael Stevens (the ""Stevens Complaint"") alleges that Ellie Mae and our Board of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1034, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R., 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9, and Regulation G, 17 C.F.R. § 244.1,00 by filing this Proxy Statement, which allegedly (a) omits material information required by federal securities laws and (b) contains untrue statements of fact and/or omits material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Michelle Stevens has asked the California District Court to, among other things, (i) declare that the Stevens Complaint is properly maintained as a class action and certify plaintiff as class representative and her counsel as class counsel, (ii) enjoin the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with the special meeting of Ellie Mae's stockholders to vote on the proposed transaction or consummating the proposed transaction unless and until Ellie Mae discloses the material information that the Stevens Complaint alleges has been omitted from the Proxy Statement, (iii) direct Ellie Mae to account to plaintiff and the class for all damages sustained as result of their wrongdoing, and (iv) award plaintiff the costs of the action, included reasonable allowance for plaintiff's counsel and experts' fees.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The Target Case is discussed in the filing excerpts. The case name ""Christopher Beveridge v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al."" and case number ""1:19-cv-02390"" are mentioned in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The filing excerpts mention that ""The disclosure under the heading 'The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger' is hereby supplemented by adding the disclosures underlined below immediately after the first paragraph and before the second paragraph on page 70 of the Definitive Proxy Statement."" This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

There is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

There is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, but there is no evidence of an agreement.

}",X1Q6O2RBDM82,FALSE,hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step in accordance with the task instructions and the given excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case ""Christopher Beveridge v. Ellie Mae, Inc. et al."" with the case number ""1:19-cv-02390"" is discussed in the filing excerpts. This is correct as the case is mentioned in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM notes that the disclosure was supplemented under the heading ""The Merger - Litigation Relating to the Merger."" However, the LLM concludes that this supplemental disclosure was made in response to the lawsuit. The filing excerpt does indicate an amendment related to the merger, but it does not explicitly establish that this amendment was a result of the lawsuit. The task requires the supplemental disclosure to be specifically in response to the lawsuit, and the excerpt does not provide sufficient evidence for this connection.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. This is consistent with the excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM concludes that there is no formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution, which matches the excerpts' content.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no mention or implication of an agreement in the excerpts, which the LLM correctly identifies.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

This step is not applicable because no agreement was found, and the LLM correctly acknowledges this.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM summarizes that supplemental disclosure was made, but there is no evidence of an agreement. However, the assertion that supplemental disclosure was made ""in response"" to the lawsuit is incorrect. The excerpts don't provide a direct link that the disclosure was a response to the lawsuit; hence, this is a misinterpretation.

**Final Analysis**

The LLM correctly identifies the mention of the Target Case and the absence of any settlement or other agreements. However, it incorrectly assumes that the supplemental disclosure was in response to the lawsuit without explicit evidence in the filing excerpts. This constitutes a hallucination as it relies on an unsupported assumption.

Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions.

(13) REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS

Nature of the Company's Products and Offerings

Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 - Revenue and Contract Costs in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 for further information regarding our application of ASC 606, including practical expedients and judgments applied in determining the amounts and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following table provides the amount of revenue that is not subject to ASC 606, but is instead governed by other accounting standards:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Three Months Ended September 30,                                          |
|                                                 | 2019          | 2018    |
|                                                 | (in millions)           |
| Revenue from Contracts with Customers - ASC 606 | $ 346.9       | 380.9   |
| Lease Revenue - ASC 842 (1)                     | 291.7         | 260.2   |
| Total revenue                                   | $ 638.6       | $ 641.1 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Includes revenue from use of long-term Fiber Contracts and Colocation solutions, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. See Note 14 - Leases.

Remaining Performance Obligation Associated with Non-Lease Arrangements

A majority of the Company's revenue is provided over a contract term. When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price relates to performance obligations that are yet to be satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.

Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company's contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. At September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1.2 billion. For contracts with original durations of more than one year remaining, we expect to recognize approximately 49.3%, 31.2% and 13.2% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the remainder of the nine months ended June 30, 2020, year ended June 30, 2021 and year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, with the remaining balance thereafter.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0572
- **case name**: Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-25
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, Case No. 2019-0572-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the context suggests that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it is not clear if it was directly in response to the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}
```",X1Q6O40473O2,FALSE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies the mention of the Target Case, ""Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR,"" in the filing excerpts. This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed within the context.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM identifies that the company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. However, the filing does not explicitly mention that these supplemental disclosures were in response to the Target Case. The LLM incorrectly implied a link between the supplemental disclosures and the broader context of complaints, including the Target Case, without explicit evidence tying the two directly.

The LLM’s conclusion that the supplemental disclosure was related to the Target Case is a misinterpretation because the filings do not explicitly connect the disclosure to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly states that there is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""settlement agreement"" related to the Target Case in the excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM correctly determines that there is no mention of other formal agreements related to the Target Case in the filing excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM does not identify any implied agreements, which is consistent with the excerpts that do not strongly imply such an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

As no explicit or implied agreements were found, step 6 does not apply.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concluded a ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" based on the broader context of complaints but without direct evidence linking the disclosure to the Target Case, which is incorrect. There is no explicit evidence linking the supplemental disclosure to the Target Case, as required by the task instructions.

**Final Analysis and Conclusion**

The LLM has made a hallucination by determining the supplemental disclosure was made in response to the Target Case without explicit evidence. The decision should have been ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" because there is no direct mention of the disclosure being associated with the Target Case.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0572
- **case name**: Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-25
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo"" with case number 2019-0572. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the context suggests that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints filed against the Company, which includes the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it is not clear if it was directly in response to the Target Case. I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not explicitly associated with supplemental disclosure.""
}
```",X1Q6O40473O2,FALSE,hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo,"" case number 2019-0572, is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. Therefore, there is no issue with this step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM states that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. However, it fails to confirm that the supplemental disclosures were specifically made in response to the Target Case, as required by the task instructions. While the context suggests that supplemental disclosures were made in response to complaints, the LLM does not provide evidence that the disclosures are directly linked to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly notes that there is no mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM accurately concludes that there is no mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM finds no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case, which is consistent with the provided excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no explicit or implied agreement is found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it is not clear if it was directly in response to the Target Case. It correctly states there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Analysis**

The LLM's identification and extraction of information regarding the supplemental disclosures lack the specificity of a direct connection to the Target Case as required by the instructions. The context suggesting the disclosures were made in response to multiple complaints, including the Target Case, is vague without explicit confirmation. Therefore, the response lacks specificity required by the task, making the response slightly misleading about direct association.

"<filing_excerpts>
Following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement on June 3, 2019, several complaints were filed against the Company and its Board of Directors challenging the Merger. Four actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Scarantino v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01068-RGA (D. Del.), Klein v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01085-RGA (D. Del.), Duggan v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01112-RGA (D. Del.), and Dixon v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01123-RGA (D. Del.); one action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado captioned Graves v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-01747-LTB (D. Colo.); and one action was filed in the District Court of Boulder County, Colorado captioned Saroop v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019CV30601. The complaints generally alleged, among other things, that the Company and its directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy statement or that the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the merger, a declaration that the proxy statement violated federal securities laws, unspecified damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs in those actions have reserved the right to seek an award for attorneys' fees for causing the filing of the supplemental disclosures.

Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019). Three complaints were treated as one consolidated action, and on October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. The parties are meeting and conferring to resolve any outstanding questions regarding production, and plaintiffs are obligated to dismiss their cases once that process concludes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 sets forth information relating to other important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report discussed above, except as stated below.

Our business depends on the demand for our bandwidth infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our bandwidth infrastructure or services).

Our customers' demand for our bandwidth infrastructure depends on the demand for data. The willingness of our customers to utilize our bandwidth infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our bandwidth infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:

· | consumers' and organizations' demand for data;

· | availability or capacity of our bandwidth infrastructure or associated land interests;

· | location of our bandwidth infrastructure;

· | financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;

· | willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;

· | need for integrated networks and organizations;

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, Case No. 2019-0572-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019);""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

This indicates that the Company made supplemental disclosures, but it does not explicitly state that it was in response to the lawsuit. However, the sentence that follows suggests a connection:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures during the six months ended December 31, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This implies that the supplemental disclosures were made in response to the complaints, which includes the Target Case. Therefore, I conclude that the Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I found the following sentence:

""On October 8, 2019, the parties executed a Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement whereby the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action.""

This explicitly mentions a ""Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4-6: Search for Other Agreements and Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since I found an explicit settlement agreement, I do not need to search for other agreements. The settlement agreement is case-specific, and the context confirms that it pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I conclude that:

* The Company made supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.
* The Company reached a settlement agreement with the parties of the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

}
```",X1Q6O40473O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Analysis of LLM's Response:**

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identified and confirmed that the Target Case, Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, Case No. 2019-0572-TMR, is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The LLM found that the Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement on June 26, 2019. However, the supplemental disclosure mentioned does not specify that it was made in response to the lawsuit specifically. The LLM inferred that the disclosure was a response to the lawsuit based on the fact that the complaints, including the Target Case, were voluntarily dismissed as moot afterward. The LLM interprets this as an implication that the disclosures were made in response to the lawsuits, which is a reasonable inference, though not explicitly stated.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM found an explicit ""Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement"" dated October 8, 2019, where the Company agreed to produce certain books and records to the plaintiffs, in full satisfaction and dismissal of the consolidated action. This is indeed an explicit settlement related to the Target Case, as the settlement directly involves the parties of the Target Case and resulted in dismissal.

**Steps 4-6: No Need to Search for Other Agreements or Confirm Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since an explicit settlement agreement was identified, there was no need to search for additional agreements. The LLM correctly linked the settlement to the Target Case due to its case-specific nature.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM appropriately summarized the results, concluding that the Company made supplemental disclosures and reached a settlement agreement with the parties of the Target Case.

**Conclusion:**
The LLM's response includes reasonable interpretations of the excerpts provided, and there are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or critical divergences from the task instructions. The supplemental disclosure connection to dismissing the lawsuits, though inferred, is pragmatically in line with the given context.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0589
- **case name**: Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-07-31
- **case count**: Delaware Court of Chancery
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2019-0589-TMR. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""Three stockholders also filed complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 8 Del. C. §220 seeking corporate books and records, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund, et al. v. Zayo, C.A. No. 2019-0572-TMR (July 25, 2019); Massachusetts Laborers' Annuity Fund v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0573-TMR; and Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2019-0589-TMR (July 31, 2019).""

Since the Target Case is mentioned, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019.""

However, this sentence does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. But the following sentence provides more context:

""In light of those supplemental disclosures, as of September 30, 2019, each of the above-referenced complaints was voluntarily dismissed as moot.""

This suggests that the supplemental disclosure is related to the complaints, which include the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""The Company issued supplemental disclosures in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of an agreement.""
}
```",X1Q6O41D9R82,FALSE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion** The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, Waterhouse v. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc., Case No. 2019-0589, is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The case is listed among other complaints filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking corporate books and records. The LLM successfully confirms the existence of the Target Case discussion in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure** The LLM identifies a statement about supplemental disclosures issued by the company in the definitive proxy statement dated June 26, 2019. The LLM interprets the sentence mentioning that complaints were voluntarily dismissed as moot ""in light of those supplemental disclosures"" as an association between the supplemental disclosures and the referenced complaints, including the Target Case. This interpretation leads the LLM to conclude ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure.""

However, it is important to note that while the supplemental disclosures were issued, the excerpts do not explicitly state that these disclosures were made specifically in response to the Target Case. The quoted context mentions multiple complaints, and while they were dismissed as moot following the disclosures, it does not explicitly confirm that the disclosures were made because of these specific cases.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement** The LLM does not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" for the Target Case, which is accurate according to the excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements** The LLM correctly determines that there is no mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement** The LLM finds no strong implication of an agreement pertaining to the Target Case, which is consistent with the filing excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case** Since no agreements were identified, this step is not applicable, as correctly noted by the LLM.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results** The LLM concludes with a ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement."" While the LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit agreement related to the Target Case, the decision to mark ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" is based on an inferred context rather than explicit evidence that the disclosure was made in response to the Target Case.

**Final Analysis** The LLM's determination of ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" relies on contextual inference rather than explicit evidence directly linking the supplemental disclosure to the Target Case, which may not strictly align with the task's explicit instruction requirement. There's an implied connection made by the filings, but it's not explicitly attributed to the Target Case. Therefore, the response can be considered a hallucination because it extrapolates beyond the explicit instructions and excerpts.

This analysis diverges from the task instruction to rely on explicit mentions. Thus, the LLM's 'Yes' conclusion for supplemental disclosure is deemed a hallucination."",

"<filing_excerpts>
As previously disclosed in the Company's Form 8-K and Schedule 14A filed on January 29, 2019, after the Proxy Statement was filed, the following putative class actions were commenced by purported stockholders of the Company:

(i) in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the ""Sabatini Complaint"");

(ii) in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint""), which was subsequently dismissed voluntarily without prejudice on February 1, 2019;

(iii) in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint""); and

(iv) in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint"").

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 19CV-0043. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following sentence:

""(ii) in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint""), which was subsequently dismissed voluntarily without prejudice on February 1, 2019;""

This confirms that the Target Case is indeed discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found the following sentence:

""While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").""

This indicates that the Company has agreed to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits. However, it is not explicitly stated that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. 

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since the supplemental disclosure is not explicitly associated with the Target Case, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a settlement agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" because the supplemental disclosure is not explicitly associated with the Target Case. I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"" because I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case mentioned but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found.""
}
```",NOBLAW88654975,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The target case ""Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al."" with case number 19CV-0043 is confirmed to be discussed in the provided filing excerpts. The LLM correctly identifies that the filing includes a mention of the target case and its dismissal.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM correctly identifies a supplemental disclosure statement in the filing excerpts, which states: ""the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below."" However, it notes that there is no explicit statement that this supplemental disclosure is directly in response to the target case (Schmit Complaint). The supplemental disclosure is in response to several complaints collectively rather than specifically to the Schmit case alone.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM observes no explicit mention of a settlement agreement or an ""MOU"" related to the target case.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

No specific, formal agreement associated with the target case is identified in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM correctly notes the absence of any implied agreement related to the target case.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

As the LLM found no agreements, there is no need to confirm their association with the target case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes with ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement,"" citing the lack of direct association with the target case for the former and the non-existence of any agreement for the latter. This conclusion may seem counterintuitive; however, given the task's specific instruction to tie any supplemental disclosure explicitly to the target case, the LLM adheres quite strictly to the requirement that a direct association be evident.

**Final Summary:**

The LLM accurately identifies the relevant sections of the filing excerpts concerning case mentions and supplemental disclosures but maintains a conservative interpretation aligning strictly with the task instructions, which demand explicit case-specific associations for disclosure actions. The LLM's decision to answer ""No"" for supplemental disclosure due to this lack of specificity is in line with a stringent adherence to the task instruction, even though the disclosure indeed applies broadly to complaints, including the mentioned Schmit case.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043, filed on January 24, 2019, in the California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Target Case. The Filing Excerpts mention other cases, such as the Ryan Complaint, Luxor Complaint, Tang Complaint, and Kumar Complaint, but not the Schmit case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and proceed to the next step.

1. **Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
   - The task first requires confirming whether the Target Case, ""Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043,"" is discussed in the filing excerpts.
   - The provided filing excerpts do not mention this Target Case. The cases mentioned include the Ryan Complaint, Luxor Complaint, Tang Complaint, and Kumar Complaint, but not the Schmit case.
   - Therefore, the LLM correctly identified that the Target Case is not mentioned in the filing excerpts.

2. **Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
   - The LLM has determined that the Target Case was not mentioned in the filing excerpts.
   - Based on the task instructions, if the Target Case is not mentioned, the answer to whether supplemental disclosure was made should be ""No"".
   - The LLM correctly answered ""No"" for supplemental disclosure.

3. **Steps 3 to 7: Determine Agreement**
   - Since the Target Case was not mentioned, these steps are not applicable.
   - The LLM did not proceed with these steps, which aligns with the instructions given the absence of the Target Case in the excerpts.

**Final Determination:**

- The LLM correctly analyzed that the Target Case was not mentioned in the filing excerpts, which affected both the decision on supplemental disclosure and any agreement.
- No hallucination occurred in identifying the presence or absence of mentions in the excerpts.
- The LLM's response appropriately followed the task instructions.

As previously disclosed, on April 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 9, 2018 (the ""Merger Agreement""), among the Company, Vertex Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (""Parent""), and Vertex Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub are owned by an investor group led by the private equity investment firm Francisco Partners. On May 21, 2018, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") the Definitive Proxy Statement with respect to the special meeting of the Company's stockholders scheduled to be held on June 19, 2018, in connection with the Merger (the ""Special Meeting"").

Litigation Related to the Merger

As previously disclosed, in connection with the Merger, two putative class action lawsuits, Scarantino v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00752-VAC-CJB, and Byrne v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:18-cv-02926-YGR, were filed on May 17, 2018, against the Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively. On May 30, 2018, a third lawsuit, Raul v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-03215-JSW, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and on June 1, 2018, a fourth lawsuit, Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al. Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on May 7, 2018, in connection with the Merger misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The allegations relate to the Company's financial projections, the valuation analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, the background of the Merger, and any potential conflicts of interest of the Company's management or directors with respect to the Merger. The complaints allege that such misrepresentations and/or omissions render the proxy statement false and misleading and accordingly allege violations of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction against the consummation of the Merger, costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' and experts' fees, declaratory relief, and any other relief the courts may deem just and proper. On May 25, 2018, the plaintiff in the Byrne action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the holding of the Special Meeting until certain additional information is disclosed in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement.

While the Company believes that the actions lack merit and that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"").

Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of the Supplemental Disclosures. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations that any of the Supplemental Disclosures, or any other additional disclosures, were or are required.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT

These Supplemental Disclosures should be read in conjunction with the Definitive Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references in the information below are to pages in the Definitive Proxy Statement, and all capitalized terms used below shall have the meanings set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement. Paragraph references used herein refer to the proxy statement before any additions or deletions resulting from the supplemental disclosures. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Definitive Proxy Statement. The information contained herein speaks only as of June 6, 2018 unless the information indicates that another date applies.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On February 26, 2018 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On February 26, 2018, the Company and Party 1 amended their previously existing non-disclosure agreement, dated as of July 16, 2016, to extend the term thereof in connection with Party 1's interest in evaluating a potential transaction between the parties and to require the Company's prior written consent before approaching any potential co-investor or other provider of debt or equity financing. The non-disclosure agreement, as amended, with Party 1 did not contain any standstill restrictions.

The Section of the Proxy Statement titled ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by amending the paragraph on Page 32 that begins ""On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 . . ."" as follows to add the underlined sentence:

On March 1, 2018, the Company and Party 2 entered into a customary non-disclosure agreement in connection with the evaluation of a potential transaction between the parties. The non-disclosure agreement with Party 2 did not contain any standstill restrictions. Party 1 and Party 2 determined that they would work together to evaluate whether to make a joint proposal to acquire the Company. We refer to Party 1 and Party 2 together as the Joint Bidder Group. That same day, the Company provided access to an electronic dataroom to Joint Bidder Group to facilitate their due diligence review.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"" as one of the four lawsuits filed against the Company and its directors. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"") in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation and following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions. Although the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the supplemental disclosure, it is one of the four lawsuits mentioned in the same section. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the supplemental disclosure is related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, but I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, Lowinger v. VeriFone Systems, Inc., Case No. 1:18-cv-00829-UNA, is mentioned in the filing excerpts under ""Litigation Related to the Merger"" as one of the four lawsuits filed against the company. Therefore, the case discussion step was accurately addressed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM states that the company decided to ""voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below"" following discussions with counsel for plaintiffs in the Scarantino and Byrne actions. However, the filing excerpts do not indicate that the supplemental disclosure was made ""in response to the Target Case"" specifically. The LLM's assumption that the supplemental disclosure is related to the Target Case just because it is one of the four lawsuits mentioned does not align with the instructions, which require that the supplemental disclosure be directly linked to the Target Case. This step includes a misinterpretation because the decision to make supplemental disclosures was specifically linked to the Scarantino and Byrne actions, not the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly states that there is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case present in the excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no mention of any formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM correctly concludes there is no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

The LLM correctly concludes no explicit or implied agreement pertains to the Target Case, based on the absence of any such information in the excerpts.

**Analysis Summary**

The LLM correctly identifies and addresses the presence of the Target Case in the filing excerpts and rightly concludes the absence of any agreements related to it. However, the LLM erroneously assumes the supplemental disclosure pertains to the Target Case without explicit linkage as required by the instructions. The excerpts clearly attribute the supplemental disclosure to discussions with parties in other cases (Scarantino and Byrne), not Lowinger. Consequently, the output labeling ""supplemental_disclosure"" as ""Yes"" for the Target Case constitutes a misinterpretation.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Wang v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-11435. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the passage mentions ""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented..."" which indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure. However, it does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. But since the supplemental disclosure is related to the Offer and the Merger, and the lawsuit is also related to the Offer, it can be inferred that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosure, but there is no explicit or implied agreement.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
- The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Wang v. Foundation Medicine, Inc. et al., No. 1:18-cv-11435,"" is mentioned in the filing excerpts. This information is precise, as the case is indeed referred to in the passage.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
- The LLM finds a mention of ""Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented,"" indicating the Company made supplemental disclosure. It correctly points out that the filing excerpts do not explicitly state that this supplementation is a response to the lawsuit.
- However, the LLM assumes that since the supplemental disclosure is related to the Offer and the Merger, and the lawsuit is also related to the Offer, it can be inferred that the supplemental disclosure is in response to the lawsuit. 
- This inference is not supported by explicit information in the excerpts. According to the task instructions, an explicit mention linking the supplemental disclosure to the lawsuit is required, not an inference based on tangential connection.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
- The LLM did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case, which is accurate based on the provided excerpts.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**
- The LLM correctly states that there is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" in the filing excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- The LLM correctly determines that there is no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
- Since no agreement exists, this step is correctly deemed not applicable by the LLM.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
- The LLM concludes that the company has made supplemental disclosure and that there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case. This conclusion about supplemental disclosure is not entirely correct because the supplemental disclosure is not explicitly tied to the lawsuit in the excerpts provided.

Final Determination:
- The LLM incorrectly inferred that the supplemental disclosure was in response to the lawsuit when the excerpts do not provide an explicit link. The task instructions specifically require an explicit mention for such a connection to be acknowledged. This constitutes a hallucination.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-UNA"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" under Item 8. Therefore, I can confirm that there is a discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented its Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement by adding a new subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" and attaching the full complaint as Exhibit (a)(5)(J). This can be considered as a form of supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I found a valid supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" since the Company has amended and supplemented its Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement. I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"" since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement.

```",X1Q6O1BM4782,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case, ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-UNA,"" is discussed in the Filing Excerpts. The case is mentioned in the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" under Item 8.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The task requires identifying if there is an explicit mention of supplemental disclosure made in response to the lawsuit. The LLM interprets the amendment of the Schedule 14D-9 and the addition of the section ""Certain Litigation"" as supplemental disclosure. However, the task required a direct link between the supplemental disclosure and the lawsuit. The excerpt does not provide explicit evidence that the disclosure was in direct response to the lawsuit; rather, it only states that the complaint was attached. The LLM's assertion that these actions constitute a ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure appears to stretch the definition slightly, as the excerpt lacks direct language indicating the disclosure was in response to the lawsuit. However, given the context of the disclosure's content focused on litigation, the LLM's interpretation could be considered a reasonable inference, albeit not strictly following a literal reading of the instructions.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
There is no mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU,"" which the LLM correctly identifies.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
No formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution is mentioned, as concluded by the LLM.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
The LLM correctly assesses that there is no implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since no agreement was identified, this step is not applicable. The LLM concluded correctly.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM concludes ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement."" The supplemental disclosure answer is based on adding a new litigation subsection and the amendment of Schedule 14D-9, which could be considered partially inferred rather than explicit as desired by task precision.

**Final Analysis**
While the LLM reasonably interpreted the provided materials, its conclusion that there was supplemental disclosure in response to a lawsuit is not explicitly supported by the excerpt. However, no egregious hallucination occurred, given the reasonable inference around the context of disclosure additions relating to litigation; hence, the LLM did not make a clear hallucination but inferred beyond literal task instruction.

Explanatory Note

As previously disclosed, subsequent to Essendant filing the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, four complaints were filed by purported stockholders of Essendant in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information. Essendant believes that the actions are without merit. The Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018.

While Essendant believes that the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Essendant denies all allegations in the complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Item 3. | Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Item 3 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence at the end of the subsection entitled ""Interests of Certain Persons; Agreements and Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company--Potential for Future Arrangements"":

""No discussions or negotiations regarding post-closing employment or directorship with, or the purchase of or participation in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation occurred between Staples and any Company executive officers or directors prior to the approval and execution of the Merger Agreement.""

Item 4. | The Solicitation or Recommendation.

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence after the sentence beginning with ""Management also reviewed "" in the subsection entitled ""Background and Reasons for the Company Board's Recommendation--Background of the Offer"":

""For more information regarding these projections, see Item 4 under the heading ""Certain Financial Projections.""""

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating in its entirety the sentence beginning with ""The Management Projections were provided "" in the subsection entitled ""Certain Financial Projections"" as follows:

""The Management Projections were approved by the Company Board in January 2018 and also were provided to the Company's financial advisor, which was directed to use and rely on the Management Projections for purposes of its financial analyses and opinion.""

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the Explanatory Note section. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. In the Explanatory Note section, it is stated that ""to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures."" This indicates that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case. However, I need to confirm that the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case.

Upon reviewing the text, I found that the Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018, but the supplemental disclosure is mentioned in the context of the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions. However, since the Pietras action is one of the four complaints filed, and the supplemental disclosure is made to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims, I can infer that the supplemental disclosure is also in response to the Target Case.

Therefore, I can answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since there is no explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"", the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since there is no explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, including the Target Case.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN"". The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case is mentioned in the filing excerpts, thereby confirming that there is a discussion of the Target Case. This part is handled correctly.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The task requires assessing whether supplemental disclosure was made specifically in response to the lawsuit. The excerpts state that Essendant supplemented the disclosure ""to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions."" The LLM incorrectly infers that since Pietras’s action is one of four complaints, the supplemental disclosure pertains to the Target Case. However, the excerpts explicitly specify that the disclosures were made in response to claims in the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions, and not in relation to the Pietras action.

The LLM erroneously concludes ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure, including the Target Case. This is a hallucination because the filing explicitly communicates that the supplemental disclosure was related to the other listed cases, excluding the Pietras action.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM accurately determines that there is no mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
The LLM verifies there is no mention of any other formal agreement concerning the Target Case. This step aligns with the excerpts content.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
There is no strong implication of an agreement from the text, something the LLM discerned accurately.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since no agreement was found, this analysis correctly identifies this step as not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
Given the above analysis, the summary should have confirmed ""No"" for supplemental disclosure concerning the Target Case, with accurate data indicating no other agreements exist. However, the LLM concludes incorrectly for supplemental disclosure.

Final Determination:
The LLM incorrectly deemed that supplemental disclosure was made in response to the Target Case, which constitutes a hallucination due to the misinterpretation of the particular lawsuits to which the supplemental disclosure applies.

The Pietras Chancery Complaint alleges that the Company Board breached its fiduciary duties and/or otherwise violated Delaware law (and that Sycamore Partners, Staples, Parent and Purchaser colluded in or aided and abetted in such violations) by, among other things, purportedly (i) failing to obtain the highest value available for the Company in the marketplace; (ii) initiating a process to sell the Company that purportedly undervalues the Company and vests the Company Board with benefits that are not shared equally by the Company's public stockholders; (iii) failing to provide in the Schedule 14D-9 all material information necessary for the Company's public stockholders to decide whether to tender their Shares in the Offer; and (iv) committing waste by approving the Contemplated Transactions. The Pietras Chancery Complaint seeks to enjoin the closing of the Offer unless and until the Company adopts a procedure to obtain a purportedly fairer agreement and discloses the requested information in the Schedule 14D-9 or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer closes without the adoption of such a procedure and the disclosure of such information.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"" under Item 8. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Company has amended and supplemented Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 by inserting additional disclosure at the end of the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"". This suggests that the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. However, I need to confirm that the lawsuit is the Target Case. The filing mentions that the Pietras Chancery Complaint was filed on October 31, 2018, which matches the case filing date of the Target Case. Therefore, I can confirm that the supplemental disclosure is associated with the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Since I did not find any explicit settlement, the next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

Since I did not find any explicit agreement, the next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can summarize the results as follows:

* The Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit, which is the Target Case.
* There is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

The LLM correctly identifies that there is discussion around the Target Case, ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789,"" as it is explicitly mentioned in the filing excerpts under the subsection titled ""Certain Litigation"".

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM claims that the Company amended and supplemented Item 8 of the Schedule 14D-9 in response to the lawsuit, suggesting a supplemental disclosure was made. However, the excerpts merely state that Item 8 is amended and supplemented by inserting additional disclosure, but there is no explicit link indicating that this action was done specifically in response to the lawsuit. The filing does not explicitly state that the supplemental disclosure was intended as a response to the lawsuit; thus, the LLM has potentially over-interpreted this as an explicit response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" in the filing excerpts related to the case. Therefore, no explicit settlement is found.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The filing excerpts do not include any mention of other formal agreements indicating a resolution. The LLM correctly identifies the absence of such agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There are no strong implications or suggestions within the excerpts that an agreement exists without explicit statement.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, there is no explicit indication that the supplemental disclosure was made specifically in response to the lawsuit. Hence, the LLM's assertion that there was a supplemental disclosure in response to the Target Case is misinterpretive, as a direct causation is not firmly established in the excerpts.

Final determination: The LLM did make a hallucination by concluding that the supplemental disclosure was made specifically in response to the lawsuit.

As previously disclosed, subsequent to Essendant filing the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, four complaints were filed by purported stockholders of Essendant in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN, filed September 27, 2018; Patrick Plumley v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01521-MN, filed October 2, 2018; Long Nguyen v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01546-MN, filed October 5, 2018; and Michael J Sultan v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01582-MN, filed October 15, 2018. The complaints name as defendants Essendant and its current directors. In addition, the Plumley complaint names Parent and Purchaser as defendants. The complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14D-9 omits purportedly material information. Each of the complaints seeks, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Offer unless and until the requested information is disclosed or, alternatively, to recover damages if the Offer is consummated without the disclosure of such information. Essendant believes that the actions are without merit. The Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018.

While Essendant believes that the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 comply fully with applicable law, to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosure shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosure set forth herein or in the Schedule 14D-9. To the contrary, Essendant denies all allegations in the complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Item 3. | Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Item 3 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence at the end of the subsection entitled ""Interests of Certain Persons; Agreements and Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company--Potential for Future Arrangements"":

""No discussions or negotiations regarding post-closing employment or directorship with, or the purchase of or participation in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation occurred between Staples and any Company executive officers or directors prior to the approval and execution of the Merger Agreement.""

Item 4. | The Solicitation or Recommendation.

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by inserting the following sentence after the sentence beginning with ""Management also reviewed "" in the subsection entitled ""Background and Reasons for the Company Board's Recommendation--Background of the Offer"":

""For more information regarding these projections, see Item 4 under the heading ""Certain Financial Projections.""""

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating in its entirety the sentence beginning with ""The Management Projections were provided "" in the subsection entitled ""Certain Financial Projections"" as follows:

""The Management Projections were approved by the Company Board in January 2018 and also were provided to the Company's financial advisor, which was directed to use and rely on the Management Projections for purposes of its financial analyses and opinion.""

Item 4 of the Schedule 14D-9 is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating in its entirety the sentence beginning with ""Citi calculated terminal values for the Company "" in the subsection entitled ""Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.--Financial Analyses--Discounted Cash Flow Analysis"" as follows:

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2018-0789
- **case name**: Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789

- **case count**: Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN"" is mentioned, which seems to be related to the Target Case. However, the case number and court are different. I will proceed with caution.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. I found that the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with additional disclosures to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions. The supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the lawsuits, but it is not clear if it is associated with the Target Case.

However, I found that the Pietras action was voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2018, which is the same filing date as the Target Case. This suggests that the supplemental disclosure might be related to the Target Case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any explicit or implied agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""Yes"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" because the Company has made supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuits, and it is likely associated with the Target Case.

For ""reached_agreement"", I will answer ""No"" because I did not find any explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""Yes"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""to moot certain of plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Plumley, Nguyen and Sultan actions, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay and to provide additional information to its stockholders, Essendant has determined to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 with the below disclosures."",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""The identified supplemental disclosure might be associated with the Target Case, but the court and case number are different.""
}
```",X1Q6O1M5H982,FALSE,hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The Target Case is identified as ""Joseph Pietras v. Richard D. Phillips, et al., Case No. 2018-0789."" The filing excerpts mention a similar case, ""Joseph Pietras v. Essendant Inc., et al., Case No. 1:18-cv-01506-MN,"" indicating that the case numbers and court locations differ. The LLM proceeds with caution due to this discrepancy. However, for the purposes of analysis, the existence of two case numbers with the same plaintiff suggests that the LLM may have confused them, and as such, a direct discussion of the Target Case seems absent.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The filing excerpts indicate that Essendant decided to voluntarily supplement the Schedule 14D-9 to address claims of plaintiffs in the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions. While this does suggest supplemental disclosure, it explicitly refers to these specific lawsuits and not to the discussed or differing target case. This does not confirm a supplemental disclosure directly related to the Target Case; thus, a proper determination would likely be ""No"" due to the specific references to other cases.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM does correctly identify that there is no explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case. This step is handled correctly.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly identifies that there is no explicit mention of a formal agreement resolving the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM correctly concludes there is no strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm if the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreements are found, confirming specifics isn't applicable here.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM answers ""Yes"" to supplemental disclosure in response to lawsuits, assuming it might relate due to identical plaintiffs, but does not note the presented supplemental disclosure was directly in response to the Plumley, Nguyen, and Sultan actions. The correct answer, spacing out confusion about the Pietras action voluntarily dismissed on the same date, should have been ""No.""

**Analysis**

The LLM misattributes the supplemental disclosure to the Target Case without distinguishing the explicit differences noted in the excerpts related to named actions. There is confusion due to the identical plaintiff name between cases, but the specific details of the case numbers and the distinct references clarify the actions were separate instances. Thus, the LLM's conclusion of a ""Yes"" for supplemental disclosure falsely attributes this to the Target Case discussed in the excerpts. The correct response for supplemental disclosure should have been “No” due to no direct linkage as specified.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the Merger, after the Definitive Proxy Statement was filed, four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed:

(i) | in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the ""Sabatini Complaint"");

(ii) | in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint"");

(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint""); and

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint,"" and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the ""Complaints"")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

The LLM correctly identified and confirmed that the Target Case ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"" is mentioned in the filing excerpts under ""Litigation Related to the Merger.""

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task requires identifying if the company made or planned to make supplemental disclosures or amendments in response to the lawsuit. The LLM correctly concluded that there is no mention of the Company making supplemental disclosure in response to any lawsuit in the filing excerpts.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM checked for explicit mentions of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" and correctly concluded that such terms are not present in the excerpts concerning the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM searched for other formal agreements but found none explicitly concerning the Target Case in the excerpts, which aligns with the provided information.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM checked for implied agreements and correctly identified that there is no strong implication of an agreement within the context of the filing excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreements were found, this step was appropriately not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM accurately summarized the results by stating ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement."" 

The note added by the LLM, ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement,"" is slightly misleading because the case is mentioned, but not in regard to supplemental disclosure or agreement as required by the task. Nonetheless, this is a minor oversight and does not constitute a hallucination.

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

}",X1Q6O2CUK082,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138, is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The case is listed among other complaints against MINDBODY. Therefore, the LLM did not hallucinate in confirming the Target Case discussion.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The LLM is tasked with identifying explicit mentions of supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. The filing excerpts do not contain any indication that MINDBODY planned or agreed to make supplementary disclosures or amendments related to the merger, specifically in response to the lawsuit. Thus, the LLM correctly concludes that there is no supplemental disclosure associated with the Target Case. No hallucination here.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM correctly searches for explicit mentions of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" but finds none related to the Target Case. Therefore, its conclusion that there is no explicit settlement is accurate.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
The LLM searches for formal agreements indicating resolution but finds none. The filing excerpts do not mention any agreements related to the Target Case, indicating the LLM did not hallucinate here.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
The LLM looks for implications of an agreement but finds none, which is consistent with the filing excerpts. No hallucination exists here since there's no basis for an implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since no agreement of any kind was identified, this step is not applicable, and the LLM correctly states this.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM states that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case. This conclusion aligns with the filing excerpts.

- **case filing date**: 2019-01-24
- **case count**: United States District Court of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.1, which is a complaint filed on January 24, 2019. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will check if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. However, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2CUK082,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step.

### Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion
- **LLM's Finding**: The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"" was mentioned in the Filing Excerpts, specifically in Exhibit 99.1.
- **Analysis**: The LLM's response is accurate. The presence of the Target Case is confirmed in the filing excerpts.

### Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
- **LLM's Finding**: The LLM states that there is no mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.
- **Analysis**: This assessment is correct. The filing excerpts provided do not contain any explicit mention of supplemental disclosures or amendments.

### Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
- **LLM's Finding**: The LLM did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.
- **Analysis**: Accurate based on the data. The excerpts do not discuss any settlement or MOU regarding the Target Case.

### Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
- **LLM's Finding**: No mention of any formal agreement related to the Target Case was found.
- **Analysis**: This finding is also correct. The excerpts don't mention formal agreements regarding the Target Case.

### Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
- **LLM's Finding**: The LLM did not identify any strong implications of an agreement.
- **Analysis**: This conclusion is accurate as there is no such implication in the filing excerpts provided.

### Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
- **LLM's Finding**: This step was skipped as no agreement was found.
- **Analysis**: Given the prior findings, it's appropriate that the LLM did not proceed with this step.

### Step 7: Summarize the Results
- **LLM's Summary**: The final answer was ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".
- **Analysis**: These conclusions align with the evidence (or lack thereof) found in the excerpts.

### Conclusion
The LLM correctly followed the task instructions and accurately interpreted the excerpts without any misquotations or fabrications. It made a sound judgment that there was no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case. Therefore, no hallucination was detected in its response.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the Merger, after the Definitive Proxy Statement was filed, four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed:

(i) | in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138-UNA (the ""Sabatini Complaint"");

(ii) | in California Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, captioned Schmit v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 19CV-0043 (the ""Schmit Complaint"");

(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint""); and

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint,"" and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the ""Complaints"")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov). Copies of the proxy statement, and the filings with the SEC that will be incorporated by reference therein can also be obtained, without charge, by contacting MINDBODY's Investor Relations at (888) 782-7155, by email at IR@mindbodyonline.com, or by going to MINDBODY's Investor Relations page on its website at investors.mindbodyonline.com and clicking on the link titled ""Financials & Filings"" to access MINDBODY's ""SEC Filings.""

Participants in the Solicitation

MINDBODY and certain of its directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed Merger. Information regarding the interests of MINDBODY's directors and executive officers and their ownership of Company Common Stock is set forth in MINDBODY's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 23, 2019, in connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 5, 2018, and certain of its Current Reports on Form 8-K.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the section ""Litigation Related to the Merger"" as one of the four stockholder class action lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to look for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the case.

}",X1Q6O2CUK082,FALSE,no hallucination,"Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion
The LLM correctly identified that the Target Case, ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.,"" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138,"" is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts under ""Litigation Related to the Merger."" This shows that the case is indeed being discussed. 
Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The LLM correctly did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make a supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit. The Filing Excerpts did not provide any such details, so the LLM’s assessment was accurate in concluding ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure.""
Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The LLM correctly searched for mentions of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" but did not find any such explicit statement relating to the Target Case, as these terms do not appear in the given excerpts. Therefore, its conclusion of there being no explicit settlement is correct.
Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
The LLM searched for other forms of formal agreements and correctly identified that there is no mention of any such agreements in the Filing Excerpts. 
Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The LLM also correctly determined that there was no strong implication of an agreement between the parties, as the Filing Excerpts did not demonstrate such implications. 
Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
The LLM did not proceed with this step since no agreement was found, which is consistent with the task instructions.
Step 7: Summarize the Results
The result summary provided by the LLM is accurate based on the Filing Excerpts. The LLM reasonably concluded ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement,"" as there was not enough information indicating otherwise. Also, there was a note about the case not being mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement, which aligns with the task instructions.

- The LLM correctly identifies the mention of the Target Case, ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with the case number ""1:19-cv-00138"", in the filing excerpts under the section describing complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- The LLM accurately states that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

- The LLM correctly notes the absence of any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

- The response is accurate in stating that there is no mention of a formal agreement resolving the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

- The LLM correctly finds no strong implication of an agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

- Since no agreement was found, this step is not necessary, and the LLM does not address it, which is appropriate.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

- Based on the information from the excerpts, the LLM concludes appropriately that there is no evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Given these observations, the LLM's response does not hallucinate any information. The response is consistent and accurately reflects the task instructions and the content of the excerpts.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number ""1:19-cv-00138"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in Exhibit 99.1, which is a complaint filed on January 24, 2019. Therefore, the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since there is no agreement mentioned, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2CUK082,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM hallucinated in its response based on the task instructions and provided excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identified the mention of the Target Case (""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."") in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is referred to in Exhibit 99.1, which matches the details given (case number ""1:19-cv-00138"", filed on January 24, 2019, in the United States District Court of Delaware). Thus, the LLM's identification here is accurate, and there is no hallucination in this step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM searched for any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment by the Company in response to lawsuits. The Filing Excerpts provided do not include any statements about the Company planning or making supplemental disclosures in relation to the lawsuit. The LLM accurately reports finding no mention of such disclosures, adhering to the instructions. Therefore, the LLM does not hallucinate here.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM checked for explicit mentions of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case but correctly states that no such mentions were found. This approach aligns with the instructions, confirming there's no hallucination.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

Again, the LLM accurately reports not finding any explicit mention of formal agreements (""XXX agreement"") related to settling the Target Case. Its response is consistent with what can be extracted from the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM mentions there is no implied agreement in the Filing Excerpts, which corresponds with the content.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

As no agreement is applicable, this step does not apply, as correctly pointed out by the LLM.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the provided information and excerpts, the LLM concludes correctly that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement concerning the Target Case. This adherence to instructions indicates an accurate assessment by the LLM.

Final Determination: The LLM response does not include a hallucination, as all steps correctly follow the instructions and align with the information provided in the excerpts.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned. However, the Filing Excerpts do mention other cases, such as the Luxor Complaint, the Tang Complaint, and the Kumar Complaint, but not the Sabatini case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and proceed to the next step.

**Step 3-7: Not Applicable**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned, I will not proceed with the remaining steps.

**Final Answer**

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned.""
}",X1Q6O2CUK082,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The task is to identify whether there are references to the Target Case, ""Sabatini v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00138,"" in the provided filing excerpts. Upon reviewing the excerpts, the LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case is not mentioned. The filing excerpts contain references to various other cases, but the Sabatini case is not one of them. The LLM accurately notes this lack of mention.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not mentioned in the excerpts, the LLM correctly concludes that there is no need to search for supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case. The decision to answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" is consistent with the instructions and evidence provided.

**Step 3-7: Not Applicable**

Given the absence of the Target Case from the filing excerpts, continuing with steps 3 through 7 is indeed not applicable. The LLM does not proceed with these steps, which aligns with the task requirements since these steps are only relevant if the Target Case is mentioned.

**Final Analysis**

The LLM followed the instructions accurately by identifying that the Target Case was not mentioned in the excerpts, correctly concluding ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement,"" and noting the non-applicability of subsequent steps. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences in its approach. The response is aligned with the evidence and task instructions, meaning no hallucination was present.

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).

Participants in the Solicitation

MINDBODY and certain of its directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed Merger. Information regarding the interests of MINDBODY's directors and executive officers and their ownership of Company Common Stock is set forth in MINDBODY's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 23, 2019, in connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 5, 2018, and certain of its Current Reports on Form 8-K. Other information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation and a description of their direct and indirect interests in the proposed Merger, by security holdings or otherwise, are contained in the proxy statement and may be contained in other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger. Free copies of this document may be obtained as described in the preceding paragraph.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint"");""

Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will proceed to the next step.

The LLM accurately identifies that the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. This identification is correct as the case is one of the four listed complaints.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The search is to find any explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendments by the Company made in response to the Target Case. The LLM correctly notes that there is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosures or amendments in response to the lawsuit. The excerpts do not specify that the Company planned or made any supplemental disclosures related to this specific lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The task here is to look for any explicit mentions of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" pertaining to the Target Case. The LLM states that it did not find any such mentions, which aligns with the absence of such text in the Filing Excerpts. There is no indication of any settlement, MOU, or agreement discussions.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

Here, the LLM would need to find any formal agreement that specifies a resolution. The LLM's response that no such mention was found is accurate according to the provided excerpts, which do not refer to any formal agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next task is to determine if any agreements are strongly implied but not explicitly stated. The LLM correctly finds no implied agreement, as there is no language in the Filing Excerpts that suggests any sort of implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable. The LLM correctly moves past this step without issue.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case. This conclusion is consistent with the evidence presented in the Filing Excerpts. The response accurately reflects the absence of discussions around both supplemental disclosures and agreements concerning the Target Case.

Overall, the LLM's response correctly follows the task instructions and accurately interprets the Filing Excerpts without hallucinations.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2DLDBO2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's examine whether the LLM made any hallucinations in its response by analyzing it step by step against the task instructions and the provided excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
- The LLM correctly confirms that the Target Case, ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638,"" is mentioned in the filing excerpts. The excerpts do indeed list this case as one of the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
- The LLM did not find any explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or amendments in response to the lawsuit. The task requires an explicit mention that the Company has made or planned to make supplemental disclosure specifically in response to the lawsuit. The LLM's assessment appears accurate as the excerpts provided no such mention.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
- The LLM searched for explicit mentions of ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case but found none. This aligns with the task instructions, which require explicit evidence for these types of agreements. The excerpts do not mention such agreements, and the LLM correctly notes their absence.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
- The LLM found no explicit mention of any formal agreements that indicated a resolution. Again, the LLM followed the task instructions correctly here.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- The LLM did not find any strong implications of an agreement. This finding aligns with the absence of any textual cues in the excerpts suggesting an implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
- The LLM did not find any agreement, so this step was not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
- The LLM concluded ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement,"" which is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts.

The LLM's response followed the task instructions appropriately and there are no identifiable contradictions, misinterpretations, or unnecessary fabrications in the response. The excerpts did not provide information regarding supplemental disclosures or agreements related to the Target Case, and the LLM correctly captured that.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- The LLM must check for any strong implication of an agreement, even if not explicitly termed as 'XXX Agreement.'
- There is no indication of any implied agreement in the excerpts, aligning with the LLM's findings.

- Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable, as noted by the LLM.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2:19-cv-00638
- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the following paragraph:

""(iii) | in the United States District Court of Central District of California, captioned Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638 (the ""Tran Complaint"");""

This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found the following paragraph:

""The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief.""

However, this paragraph does not explicitly mention that the Company agreed or planned to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I will proceed to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I will proceed to check if an agreement is strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case mentioned but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found.""
}
```",X1Q6O2DLDBO2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the LLM's response:

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identifies that the Filing Excerpts mention the Target Case, ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. This confirms that the Target Case is discussed in the excerpts. There is no hallucination here.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The LLM accurately identifies the quote where the Complaints seek additional disclosure. However, it correctly notes that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit. Thus, answering ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" is justified, indicating no hallucination at this stage.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM searches for explicit mentions of ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" but does not find any, reflecting an accurate reading of the text.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
The LLM rightly points out that there is no explicit mention of other formal agreements related to the Target Case in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
The LLM checks for implied agreements but finds none. This is consistent with the information provided in the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since no agreement is found, the LLM correctly concludes with ""No"" for ""reached_agreement.""

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM's final answer is consistent with the analysis, indicating ""No"" for both supplemental disclosure and reached agreement, which matches the information in the given excerpts.

Overall, the LLM followed the task instructions accurately and did not introduce any information not found in the supporting excerpts. Its determinations were well-supported by the data provided.

(iv) | in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Ryan v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2019-0061 (the ""Ryan Complaint,"" and together with the Sabatini Complaint, Schmit Complaint, and Tran Complaint, the ""Complaints"")

The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that MINDBODY and the members of its Board of Directors purportedly omitted material information from the Proxy Statement and that the Merger and the process that led to it was procedurally and substantively flawed. The Complaints also allege claims against the members of the Company's Board of Directors and, in the case of the Ryan Complaint, Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Merger and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' allegations in the Complaints lack merit and will vigorously defend against these and any subsequently filed similar actions. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and incorporated by reference herein.

Additional Information and Where to Find It

In connection with the proposed Merger, MINDBODY has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and furnished to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, MINDBODY mailed the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of MINDBODY entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement contains important information about the proposed Merger and related matters. STOCKHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF MINDBODY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER THAT MINDBODY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MINDBODY AND THE TRANSACTION. This communication is not a substitute for the proxy statement or for any other document that MINDBODY may file with the SEC and send to its stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The proposed Merger will be submitted to MINDBODY's stockholders for their consideration. Before making any voting decision, stockholders of MINDBODY are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about the proposed Merger.

Stockholders of MINDBODY are able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about MINDBODY and the proposed transaction, without charge, at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).

Participants in the Solicitation

MINDBODY and certain of its directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed Merger.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638"". Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the section describing the complaints filed against MINDBODY.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will not proceed with confirming whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

}",X1Q6O2DLDBO2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response by evaluating its reasoning step-by-step:

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies the Target Case ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:19-cv-00638"" is mentioned within the filing excerpts. This matches the information provided in the excerpts, confirming the Target Case is discussed appropriately.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM correctly states that there is no explicit mention of supplemental disclosure or an amendment being planned or made by the Company in response to the lawsuit. The available excerpts from the filings do not mention any supplemental disclosure related to the Tran case.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM searches for explicit settlements and rightly concludes that there are no mentions of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the Target Case in the filing excerpts. This aligns with the original content as no such terms are presented.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

Again, the LLM correctly does not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" indicating a resolution, as the excerpts lack any mention of agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM does not find any strong implication of an agreement, which remains consistent with the information in the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement has been detailed, the LLM rightfully does not proceed to this step.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM concludes with answering ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement,"" which matches the absence of such details in the excerpts.

Overall, the LLM's response and reasoning align well with the task's requirements and provided excerpts. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergence from the task instructions in its well-sequenced analysis.

Therefore, the Target Case is mentioned in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

The Ryan Complaint alleges, among other things, that the irrevocable proxies granted by Richard Stollmeyer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board, certain parties related to Richard Stollmeyer, and Institutional Venture Partners XIII, L.P. (the ""Signing Stockholders"") caused a transfer of voting control of the Signing Stockholders' Class B common stock, which in turn caused the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock to be automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock entitled to one vote for each such share of Class A common stock, as opposed to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock. If, as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Class B common stock held by the Signing Stockholders were converted into shares of Class A common stock, then, as of the Record Date: (i) there would have been 47,763,583 shares of Class A common stock and 252,950 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, (ii) 25,146,542 votes would constitute a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY common stock required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the holders of such majority of the voting power would constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (iii) the Signing Stockholders would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 6.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 8.43% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by the Signing Stockholders), and (iv) our directors and executive officers would have held, in the aggregate, approximately 1.33% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of MINDBODY's common stock (and approximately 9.33% when taking into account MINDBODY options and RSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers). The Company vigorously disputes the allegations in the Ryan Complaint and the claim that the Signing Stockholders' shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock, and believes that the numbers and percentages as of the Record Date are as set forth in the Proxy Statement. However, even if the Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock as alleged in the Ryan Complaint, the Board of Directors nonetheless encourages stockholders to vote ""FOR"" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the other proposals set forth in the Proxy Statement.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Schedule 14A, also filed on January 29, 2019, counsel for Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP, Luxor Capital Partners Offshore, Ltd., Luxor Capital Group, LP, LCG Holdings, LLC, Lugard Road Capital GP, LLC and Luxor Management, LLC (together, ""Luxor"") sent a demand letter (""the Luxor Demand Letter"") to MINDBODY pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL"").

After the Company's January 29th filings, on January 30, 2019, Luxor filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, captioned Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc., Case No. 2019-0070 (the ""Luxor Complaint""), included below, on January 31, 2019, Hyan Tang, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of Delaware, captioned Tang v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:19-cv-00210-UNA (the ""Tang Complaint""), included below; and on February 4, 2019, Sunil Kumar, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative class action suit in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, captioned Kumar v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al., Case No. (the ""Kumar Complaint,"" included below, and together with the Sabatini Complaint, the Schmit Complaint, the Tran Complaint, the Ryan Complaint, the Luxor Complaint and the Tang Complaint, the ""Complaints"").

The following documents in connection with the Luxor Complaint are also included below: Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, Luxor's Statement of Good Cause, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 30, 2019, MINDBODY's Opposition to Luxor's Motion to Expedite, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 1, 2019, Luxor's Reply to MINDBODY's Opposition, filed in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on February 4, 2019, and the Order of the Court of Chancery of Delaware, granted on February 4, 2019.

The Company believes the Complaints are without merit, and the Company has vigorously defended and continues to vigorously defend against the Complaints.

While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures""). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints that any additional disclosure was or is required.

Supplemental Disclosures to Proxy Statement

The following supplemental information should be read in conjunction with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. Underlined text shows text being added to a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement and a line through text shows text being deleted from a referenced disclosure in the Proxy Statement.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure after the first paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:

In the first half of August 2018, as part of Qatalyst Partners' customary coverage of software companies, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a meeting with Mr. Stollmeyer. Following this meeting, Qatalyst Partners reached out to Vista, Party A, and Party B as typical outreach to connect strategic companies, including MINDBODY, to such parties.

Separately, on August 7, 2018, a representative of Vista emailed Mr. Stollmeyer, offering to meet for lunch, which took place on September 4, 2018, and at which Mr. Stollmeyer provided the representative of Vista with a general overview of MINDBODY and its approach to the fitness, beauty and wellness services industries as was typical for Mr. Stollmeyer to present to potential investors.

On September 19, 2018, Mr. Stollmeyer received an invitation from the representative of Vista to attend an annual ""meet and greet"" conference hosted by Vista bringing together hundreds of executives in the technology sector, including from Vista's portfolio companies.

The disclosure under the heading ""The Merger--Background of the Merger"" is hereby supplemented by adding the underlined disclosure in the second paragraph under that heading on page 26 of the Proxy Statement:
</filing_excerpts>

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2:19-cv-00638
- **case name**: Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al.; Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-28
- **case count**: United States District Court of Central District of California
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case. The Target Case is ""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a mention of a ""Kumar Complaint"" filed in the United States District Court of the Central District of California, which is the same court as the Target Case. Additionally, there is a mention of a ""Tran Complaint"" in the same paragraph as the Kumar Complaint, but it does not provide any details about the case. 

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

Since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will proceed with caution. However, I found that the Company has made supplemental disclosures in response to lawsuits, as stated in the Filing Excerpts: ""While the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to moot plaintiffs' disclosure claims in the Complaints, avoid nuisance and possible expense, and provide additional information to the Company's stockholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the ""Supplemental Disclosures"")."" 

However, it is unclear whether the supplemental disclosure is specifically in response to the Target Case. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" due to the lack of explicit mention of the Target Case.

**Step 3-6: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, Handle Implied Agreement, and Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**

Since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, I will not proceed with these steps.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned in the Filing Excerpts. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"".

Here is the JSON object with the final answer:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned.""
}
```",X1Q6O2DLDBO2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step, checking for any contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences from the task instructions.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case (""Tran v. MINDBODY, Inc. et al."" with case number 2:19-cv-00638) is not explicitly mentioned in the filing excerpts. The LLM notes that there is a mention of other complaints, specifically the ""Kumar Complaint"" and a ""Tran Complaint"" without detailed information. This recognition aligns with the instruction to confirm whether the Target Case is discussed. The response accurately points out that the Target Case is not explicitly addressed in detail.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM identifies that the Company has made supplemental disclosures related to lawsuits. However, the LLM correctly refrains from associating those disclosures directly with the Target Case due to the lack of specific mention. This follows the instructions correctly where it is guided to determine the relation of supplemental disclosure to the Target Case if explicitly mentioned.

**Steps 3-6: Search for Explicit Settlement, Other Agreements, Handle Implied Agreement, and Confirm the Agreement Pertains the Target Case**

The LLM notes that since the Target Case is not explicitly mentioned, proceeding with these steps is unnecessary. This is logical as without explicit mention or linkage, these steps cannot be further explored.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM correctly answers ""No"" to both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement"" due to the absence of explicit mention of the Target Case and associated agreements.

**Final Analysis:**

The LLM followed the instructions accurately and logically concluded based on the content provided. There were no misinterpretations or hallucinations, as the response accurately aligns with the instructions.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively ""Luxor"" or ""Plaintiffs""), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby move for the entry of an order expediting proceedings in this action. The grounds for this motion are as follows:

BACKGROUND

1. Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of 13.8% of Mindbody's common stock, worth approximately $136,748,815.92 as of market close on December 21, 2018.

2. On December 24, 2018, Mindbody announced that Mindbody, Torreys Parent LLC (""Parent""), and Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"") had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Mindbody would merge into Merger Sub, with Mindbody continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management LLC (""Vista""). The Company's stockholders will vote on the Merger on February 14, 2019.

3. If the Merger closes, each share of Mindbody common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $36.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the ""Merger Consideration"").

4. The Merger is the result of an expedited sale process triggered by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Richard Stollmeyer's, seemingly unauthorized efforts to shop the Company. Given the hasty sale process, it is no wonder that the Merger Consideration significantly undervalues the Company.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the ""Demand"") pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220.

7. The purposes of the Demand are to investigate: (i) whether the members of the Mindbody Board of Directors (the ""Board"") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger; (ii) whether the members of the Board were independent with respect to the Merger and any related matters; (iii) the value of Luxor's shares and the fairness of the Merger; (iv) whether to communicate with Mindbody stockholders in advance of the vote on the Merger; (v) the completeness and accuracy of the Company's disclosures regarding the Merger; and (vi) whether to pursue a pre-closing injunction, appraisal, corrective measures, or a post-closing money damages claim in relation to the Merger.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned, and the provided text appears to be a court filing related to this case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, we can also stop here and conclude that there is no supplemental disclosure. We will proceed to search for an explicit settlement to answer the second question.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement in the provided Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable, as we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that:

- The Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.
- There is no explicit or implied agreement between the Company and the plaintiffs.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found.""
}
```",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze whether the LLM hallucinated in its response, based on the task instructions and supporting excerpts.

Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion
The LLM accurately confirmed that the Target Case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070 is discussed in the filing excerpts. This matches the information provided in the excerpts.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
The LLM correctly determined that there is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the lawsuit. The filing excerpts do not provide any information suggesting that supplemental disclosure was made.

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
The LLM indicated that it found no mention of a Settlement Agreement, MOU, or any explicit settlement with the plaintiffs in the provided filing excerpts. This is consistent with the excerpts provided.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
The LLM did not find any mention of a formal agreement like ""Settlement Agreement"" or “MOU” or a named agreement type related to the resolution with the Target Case, which is accurate as per the filing excerpts.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
The LLM concluded there is no implied agreement, which aligns with the content of the excerpts since no language strongly suggests an implied agreement.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
This step is not applicable because no agreement was identified.

Step 7: Summarize the Results
The LLM concluded that the Company did not make supplemental disclosure or reach an agreement in connection with the lawsuit.

Final Determination:
The LLM's response correctly followed the task instructions and accurately interpreted the information in the excerpts. There is no indication of contradictions or misinterpretations, thus the LLM did not make a hallucination.

5. When Luxor tried to schedule a meeting with the Company and Vista to discuss its concerns about the sale process and the adequacy of the Merger Consideration, Mr. Stollmeyer gave Luxor the run-around and refused to facilitate such a meeting.

6. Left with no other option, on January 18, 2019, Luxor served Mindbody with a sworn demand for books and records (the ""Demand"") pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220.

8. The Company waited five business days and then responded to the Demand with a host of objections (the ""Response""). Without conceding anything, it has produced its stockholder list (but not its NOBO list or attendant data), and it has offered to ""provide access to certain information that it has reasonably available.""

9. On January 29, counsel for the Company and Luxor met and conferred to discuss the scope and timing of the Company's production in response to the Demand. Company counsel confirmed that the Company was only willing to produce certain limited stocklist materials--its list of stockholders of record (produced with the Response) and its NOBO list and attendant data--but none of the substantive materials requested in Section B of the Demand.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided Filing Excerpts mention the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" which matches the Target Case. Therefore, we can confirm that there is discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

There is no explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. The Company has produced its stockholder list and offered to provide access to certain information, but this is not considered supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

There is no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

There is no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no strongly implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable as no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, the Company did not make supplemental disclosure or reach an explicit agreement with the Target Case parties.

    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",

}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The filing excerpts clearly mention the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."", which matches the Target Case. Therefore, it's accurate to state that the Target Case is discussed in the filing.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

In the task instructions, ""supplemental disclosure"" refers to amendments or additional information provided by the defendant company in response to a lawsuit. The filing excerpts mention that the Company produced a stockholder list and offered access to certain information but did not state this as a supplemental disclosure specifically in response to the lawsuit.

The LLM correctly interpreted this in its response, noting that the provided actions do not actually constitute a supplemental disclosure as defined in the task instructions.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The excerpts do not contain any mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"". The LLM's response accurately reflects the absence of these explicit mentions.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

No formal agreement is mentioned in the excerpts. The LLM correctly identifies this lack.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The excerpts do not hint at any implied agreement, and the LLM notes this correctly in the response.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

As there was no agreement found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM’s response concludes that there was no supplemental disclosure or agreement documented in the filing for the Target Case. This aligns with the contents of the excerpts and the provided definition of these elements in the task instructions.

**Final Analysis**

The LLM's analysis follows the task instructions correctly and does not misinterpret or invent information from the provided excerpts. Thus, there is no hallucination in the LLM's response.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with a case number of 2019-0070 and a filing date of 2019-01-30. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the caption of the case matches the Target Case, and the filing date also matches. Therefore, I confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment. The Filing Excerpts only contain general information about the case, such as the caption, date filed, and counsel for the plaintiff. Therefore, I conclude that there is no supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since I did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my analysis, I conclude that the Company did not make any supplemental disclosure or reach an agreement with the Target Case parties.

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step based on the task instructions and excerpts.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identifies the Target Case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with the correct case number 2019-0070 and filing date, January 30, 2019, as appearing in the Filing Excerpts. Therefore, it is accurate to conclude that there is discussion around the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM correctly states that there is no mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment specifically made by the Company in response to the lawsuit in the provided Filing Excerpts. This interpretation aligns with the contents of the excerpts, which only provide basic case details and no implications of supplemental disclosures.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM states that there is no mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case in the excerpts. This statement is accurate, as the provided content does not include any information about settlements or agreements.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

This step follows from the previous and is correctly identified by the LLM as having no data pointing to any explicit formal agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

No implied agreements are suggested in the excerpts, a correct observation by the LLM.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

As the LLM identified no agreements, evaluating whether any agreements pertain to the Target Case is not applicable, which the LLM correctly notes.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM’s conclusion that there was no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case is accurate and consistent with the provided information.

Given this analysis, the LLM did not enact any contradictions, misinterpretations, or diverge from the task instructions based on the evidence in the excerpts.

STATEMENT OF GOOD CAUSE

I am a partner at Abrams & Bayliss LLP and a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Delaware. With my firm, I am counsel to plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively ""Plaintiffs""). We respectfully submit that this action is inappropriate for submission to a Master in the first instance, as it involves a request for expedited consideration of a books and records demand in advance of a stockholder vote scheduled for February 14, 2019 or, in the alternative, in February or March 2019 so that the information requested can be reviewed by Plaintiffs in advance of the deadline to withdraw any appraisal demands (likely to be in mid-April). Therefore, the process of taking and briefing exceptions pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 144 would unnecessarily delay consideration of this matter.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, ""Luxor"") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (""Vista""). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand ""under oath"" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial ""no later than February 8."" Pls. Br. ¶ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts mention the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number ""2019-0070"" in the COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, which matches the target case. Therefore, we can confirm that the target case is discussed in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response in light of the task instructions and the provided excerpts.

Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion
- The LLM correctly identified and confirmed that the excerpts mention the Target Case, ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."", with the matching case number 2019-0070 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. This is consistent with the task requirements.

Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure
- The LLM checked for explicit mentions of supplemental disclosure or amendments related to the merger in response to the Target Case. It concluded that there were no such mentions. Upon reviewing the filing excerpts, this assessment seems accurate, as there is indeed no explicit indication of supplemental disclosure in response to the case. Therefore, the LLM correctly answers ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure.""

Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement
- The LLM did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. The excerpts do not provide any evidence contradicting this answer. It is correct that there is no explicit settlement mentioned in the context of the provided details.

Step 4: Search for Other Agreements
- The LLM did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution related to the Target Case. This matches the information in the excerpts, which do not discuss any specific agreements.

Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement
- The LLM did not find any strong implication of an agreement. There are no indications in the excerpts of any implied agreements that the LLM should have recognized.

Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case
- Since no agreement was found, this step is correctly identified as not applicable by the LLM.

Step 7: Summarize the Results
- The LLM concluded with ""No"" for both ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""reached_agreement."" This conclusion aligns with the analysis of the provided excerpts.

Final Determination:
- The LLM did not make a hallucination, as its response is consistent with the given excerpts and follows the task instructions. There are no contradictions, misinterpretations, or unsupported assertions.

DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S

MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220

The Complaint for Inspection of Books and Records Pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 filed by Plaintiffs Luxor Capital Partners, LP, Luxor Wavefront, LP, Lugard Road Capital Master Fund, LP, and Luxor Capital Partners Offshore Master Fund, LP (collectively, ""Luxor"") is filled with innuendo and speculation, and represents just one prong of Luxor's coordinated and premeditated campaign to disrupt--for its sole benefit--the merger between MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"") and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (""Vista""). Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint should be denied for four reasons:

First, Luxor lacks a colorable claim under Section 220. Not only was Luxor's demand grossly overbroad and lacking in any proper purpose, Luxor failed to comply with the requirements of Section 220 by (i) neglecting to submit its demand ""under oath"" and (ii) neglecting to provide sufficient evidence establishing stockholder status. As Luxor has not properly invoked the statute, the Court should not grant Luxor the privilege of expediting its claims.

Second, Luxor's strategic delay in invoking Section 220 belies the existence of any true emergency. Since MINDBODY announced the merger in December, Luxor (along with the world) has been fully aware of the deal price: $36.50 in cash per share of MINDBODY common stock--a 68% premium over the trading price on the day before announcement. Yet Luxor waited nearly three weeks before articulating its purported concerns about the adequacy of that substantial premium, and Luxor chose to do so by filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC (which its Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention). Only after Luxor's 13D failed to attract support did Luxor attempt to deploy Section 220. Thus, it was not until nearly four weeks after the merger's announcement that Luxor sent MINDBODY a books-and-records demand. And it was not until January 30, 2019, close to five weeks after the announcement, that Luxor filed this action. Luxor now abruptly seeks a trial ""no later than February 8."" Pls. Br. ¶ 23. But there is no urgency requiring a Section 220 trial to be held in less than 4 days after the hearing on the motion to expedite--and Luxor has not pointed to any precedent where this Court has ordered a trial on such short notice. Doing so would inconvenience the Court as well as MINDBODY, while advancing no legitimate goal.

Third, Luxor will not suffer any injury, much less irreparably so, without an expedited trial. MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond). Given MINDBODY's willingness to produce those core stocklist materials to Luxor, expedition is unnecessary. Any remaining dispute can be resolved on a typical Section 220 schedule. See FrontFour Capital Grp. LLC, et al. v. Medley Capital Corp., C.A. No. 2019-0021-KSJM, at 27-29 (Del. Ch. Jan. 16, 2019) (TRANSCRIPT) (prioritizing production of stocklist materials). And, because Luxor's concerns can be addressed adequately after the merger closes (if ever), there is no reason for a trial before the stockholder vote on February 14. Indeed, Luxor implicitly confirms this by requesting, in the alternative, that the Court set a trial as late as March 2019.

Finally, the equities weigh against expedition because Luxor is improperly attempting to use Section 220 to circumvent Rule 34. See Polygon Glob. Opportunities Master Fund v. West Corp., 2006 WL 2947486, at *5 (Del. Ch. Oct. 12, 2006) (""Section 220 is not intended to supplant or circumvent discovery proceedings.""). Luxor is secretly coordinating with one of the named plaintiffs in a separate action related to the merger, Ryan Jr. and Friedman v. MINDBODY, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0061-VCL (the ""Ryan/Friedman Action""), filed in this Court on January 29, 2019, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by MINDBODY's directors. In particular, on information and belief, Luxor principal Douglas Friedman is an immediate family member of Donald Friedman, a named plaintiff in the Ryan/Friedman Action. On information and belief, the Friedmans have coordinated these actions without disclosing their relationship to MINDBODY or this Court. Luxor's shadow participation in the Ryan/Friedman Action--where the breach of fiduciary duty claims that Luxor purports to be interested in investigating have already been asserted--undermines its claimed need for expedited proceedings here. It also indicates that this action is little more than a fishing expedition designed to bolster the Ryan/Friedman Action.

- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts discuss the case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070, which matches the target case. Therefore, we can confirm that the filing excerpts are related to the target case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since we did not find any supplemental disclosure, we can proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, after reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since we did not find any agreement.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the defendant company did not make any supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no indication of a settlement or agreement.

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The LLM correctly identified that the filing excerpts discuss the target case ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. This matches with the target case provided in the instructions.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The LLM did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit, in the provided excerpts. Upon reviewing the excerpts, there are indeed no indications of such supplemental disclosure, thus the LLM correctly interpreted this part.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The LLM found no explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""MOU"" related to the case. This is consistent with the filing excerpts, which do not contain any such mentions.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The LLM found no explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. This is consistent with the excerpts containing no mention of such agreements.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM found no strong implication of an agreement, which aligns with the filing excerpts. The excerpts primarily discuss procedural matters and do not suggest a resolution or agreement between the parties.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement was found in the excerpts, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM summarized the results accurately, stating that there is no mention of supplemental disclosure in response to the lawsuit or any settlement or agreement related to the target case within the filing excerpts.

**Final Assessment**

The LLM response does not contain hallucinations. It follows the task instructions accurately and correctly interprets the provided excerpts. The answers given are in alignment with the information contained in the filing excerpts, and no contradictions, misinterpretations, or divergences from the task instructions are present.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement that suggests a resolution to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution to the case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
- The task requires confirming if there's any mention of the Target Case in the filing excerpts.
- The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case (""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070) is mentioned in the excerpts.
- This step is correct, and the LLM did not hallucinate.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
- This step involves finding explicit mentions of the Company's intent or action to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit.
- The LLM correctly notes that there is no mention of any supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit in the provided excerpts.
- Hence, for this step, the LLM did not hallucinate.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
- This step requires identifying any explicit settlement terms, such as Settlement Agreement or MOU related to the Target Case.
- The LLM found no mention of any settlement-related terms in the excerpts, which is accurate.
- The LLM did not hallucinate for this step.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
- Here, the task is to identify any other formal agreements that might indicate a resolution to the case.
- The LLM indicated that no such agreements were found, which aligns with the provided excerpts.
- This step was correctly handled by the LLM without hallucinations.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- This step involves determining if any agreement is strongly implied without being explicitly stated.
- The LLM correctly states that there is no strong implication of any agreement.
- The response aligns with the excerpts, indicating no hallucination.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
- The LLM plausibly determines this step not applicable due to the absence of any agreement.
- Therefore, correctly handled without hallucinatory claims.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
- The LLM concludes that there is no discussion of supplemental disclosure or agreement regarding the Target Case in the context provided.
- This conclusion is consistent with the excerpts, and the LLM did not hallucinate.

BACKGROUND

A. | Vista Agrees to Acquire MINDBODY and MINDBODY Plans a Go-Shop.

On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY and Vista announced a merger agreement at $36.50 per share, 68% above the closing price of MINDBODY's common stock on the trading day before the merger was announced and 42% above the 30-day volume weighted average price. Compl. ¶ 2. This represents the second-highest revenue multiple ever paid by a private equity firm for a public software-as-a-service company and the third highest multiple for any public software asset. See Compl. Ex. B at 1-2. The merger is subject to approval by MINDBODY shareholders, regulatory review, and other closing conditions. MINDBODY's Board of Directors, who collectively own tens of thousands of shares of MINDBODY common stock and are thus aligned with the interests of MINDBODY'S stockholders, unanimously approved the transaction. See Compl. Ex. B. at 2. The merger agreement provided a 30-day go-shop period. Compl. ¶ 45.

B. | Luxor Publicly Criticizes the Merger in a Detailed Schedule 13D Filing.

On January 9, 2019, MINDBODY filed a preliminary proxy statement disclosing the process leading to the agreement with Vista. Compl. ¶ 77. The next day, Luxor filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC. Ex. 1, Luxor Schedule 13D (Jan. 10, 2019). After declaring the size of its MINDBODY investments--$140 million in common stock and $130 million in convertible notes--Luxor proclaimed that it ""believe[d] that the Proposed Merger significantly undervalue[d] the Shares"" and that it intended to discuss the merger with MINDBODY's stockholders, board of directors, and management.1 Id.

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned in the text. The case is referenced as ""Luxor's motion to expedite a hearing on its Section 220 complaint"" and ""Luxor's Section 220 complaint and motion fail to mention"" in the DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXPEDITE PURSUANT TO 8 DEL. C. § 220. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. However, I found that ""MINDBODY has already provided Luxor a list of MINDBODY stockholders as of the merger record date, and offered to direct its proxy solicitor to share other available stocklist information (Luxor did not respond)."" This statement suggests that MINDBODY has provided some information to Luxor, but it is not clear if this is a supplemental disclosure or amendment. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The next step is to determine whether there is an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""settlement"" or ""Settlement Agreement"" related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

The next step is to search for an explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The next step is to determine if an agreement is strongly implied but does not explicitly use the phrase 'XXX Agreement'. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement or settlement, this step is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"" and ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"To determine whether the LLM made a hallucination in its response, we will analyze each step of the LLM's reasoning process against the excerpts provided.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

- The LLM correctly identified the discussion of Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc. in the filing excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

- The LLM noted that there was no explicit mention of the Company making supplemental disclosures or amendments specifically in response to the lawsuit. The LLM did mention that MINDBODY provided Luxor with a list of stockholders, but correctly concluded this does not qualify as supplemental disclosure aimed at addressing the lawsuit, according to the task instructions which require explicit mention of disclosure in response to a lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

- The absence of any mention of a ""settlement"" or ""Settlement Agreement"" was correctly identified by the LLM.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

- The LLM did not find any mention of other formal agreements, such as an MOU or another agreement type, which aligns with the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

- The LLM correctly identified that there was no strong implication of an agreement based on the contents of the filings.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

- Since no agreement was found, this step was correctly deemed not applicable by the LLM.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

- The LLM accurately concluded with a ""No"" for both supplemental disclosure and reached agreements given the content of the excerpts.

**Analysis:**

The LLM carefully followed the instructions by verifying the presence of case discussion and searching for any explicit mentions of supplemental disclosures or agreements. It correctly identified all relevant findings—or the lack thereof—in line with the prescribed task methodology. The response reflects the task instructions and follows appropriate logical reasoning steps with careful examination of the provided excerpts.

PLAINTIFFS' REPLY IN FURTHER

SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION TO EXPEDITE

1. In its opposition, Mindbody1 contends that the Demand violates Section 220's form and manner requirements, attacks Luxor for waiting four weeks after the Merger announcement to demand books and records, complains of the burden associated with a prompt trial, urges that Luxor's concerns can be addressed post-closing, and alleges that Luxor is colluding with the plaintiffs in a plenary action. All of these arguments fail.

1 | Undefined capitalized terms have the meanings ascribed to them in Luxor's Verified Complaint (the ""Complaint"") (Dkt. 1). All exhibits references are to exhibits to the Complaint.

2. First, the Demand complies with Section 220's form and manner requirements. Moreover, Mindbody raised its form and manner objections for the first time in the opposition and thereby waived them.

3. Second, Mindbody cannot blame Luxor for the time crunch. Luxor acted diligently and sought relief within the time constraints imposed by Mindbody's breakneck transaction schedule.

4. Third, Mindbody's claim that post-closing relief is available ignores the reality that defendants in any post-closing fiduciary duty suit will argue that Luxor should have sought pre-closing relief and that it lacks standing to pursue certain claims post-closing. By refusing to produce even the most basic information, Mindbody is preventing Luxor from complying with the Delaware Supreme Court's directive to use tools at hand to conduct pre-suit investigations.

5. Fourth, Mindbody's objection to the Demand's scope is unavailing. Mindbody refused to negotiate the scope of any substantive production. It cannot now claim that overbreadth defeats expedition.

6. The Court should set a trial for as soon as possible.

</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The provided filing excerpts appear to be related to the Target Case, as the case number (2019-0070) and case name (Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.) match the information provided in the Target Case section. The filing excerpts also mention the COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, which matches the court information provided in the Target Case section. Therefore, it is confirmed that the filing excerpts discuss the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

After reviewing the filing excerpts, I did not find any explicit mention of the Company (MINDBODY, Inc.) agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger in response to the lawsuit. Therefore, I will answer ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure"".

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any explicit mention of a ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU"" (memorandum of understanding) related to the case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal ""XXX agreement"" that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any strong implication of an agreement.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement, I will answer ""No"" for ""reached_agreement"".

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my review of the filing excerpts, I did not find any evidence of supplemental disclosure or an agreement related to the Target Case.

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case discussed but no supplemental disclosure or agreement found.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's examine the LLM's response for any possible hallucinations.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The filing excerpts provide detailed information about Mindbody, Inc. and Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et al., and reference the case number 2019-0070 and the court as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. This matches the Target Case, confirming the case is discussed.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The task instructions require a search for any explicit mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or an amendment in response to the lawsuit. However, the filing excerpts provided do not contain any mention of supplemental disclosure related to the merger. The LLM correctly identifies the absence of this information and concludes with ""No"" for ""supplemental_disclosure.""

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

The task instructions indicate searching for an explicit ""Settlement Agreement"" or ""MOU."" There is no such mention in the filing excerpts, and the LLM's determination reflects this absence with ""No"" for ""reached_agreement.""

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**

The LLM correctly did not find any mention of another formal agreement (""XXX agreement"") indicating a resolution regarding the Target Case in the filing excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

The LLM finds no strong implication of an agreement that is not explicitly stated. This correctly results in a conclusion of ""No"" for ""reached_agreement.""

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**

Since no agreement is found, confirming its pertinence to the target case is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM correctly summarizes that there is no evidence of supplemental disclosure or an agreement related to the Target Case.

### Conclusion

The LLM followed the task instructions accurately and did not diverge with any incorrect additional interpretations or fabrication of information. Its final JSON output reflects the instructions and findings correctly.

","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is indeed mentioned, specifically in the court order granting the motion to expedite. The case name and number match the Target Case.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure or amendment.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since there is no supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit settlement. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any explicit mention of a formal agreement that indicates a resolution.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

There is no implied agreement suggested in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Not applicable since no agreement was found.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on the analysis, I found that there is no supplemental disclosure or agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"Let's analyze the LLM's response step by step, focusing on contradictions, misinterpretations, and any divergences from task instructions.

**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
- The LLM correctly identifies the mention of the Target Case, ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.,"" in the filing excerpts. The case number and case name match the Target Case provided, confirming that the Target Case is discussed in the filings.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
- The task requires identifying whether the Company made or planned to make supplemental disclosures in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the filing excerpts, there is no mention or implication of any supplemental disclosure related to the Target Case. The LLM accurately concludes ""No"" for supplemental disclosure.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
- The task instructions direct the search for any explicit settlement agreement, MOU, or any other agreements associated with the Target Case. Based on the provided excerpts, there are no indications of any settlement agreements or other formal agreements. The LLM again correctly concludes the nonexistence (""No"") of such settlements or agreements.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**
- Similarly, no other types of formal agreements relating to the Target Case are mentioned in the excerpts. The LLM accurately represents this finding.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
- There is no strong implication of any implied agreement in the filing excerpts. The LLM correctly identifies the absence of implied agreements.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains to the Target Case**
- Since no agreement was found in previous steps, confirmation of pertinent agreements to the Target Case is not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
- The LLM correctly summarizes that there is neither supplemental disclosure nor agreement related to the Target Case from the given excerpts.

Overall, the LLM follows the task instructions accurately, does not misquote or misinterpret the content, and provides a conclusion consistent with the information given in the excerpts.

COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Plaintiff, by his undersigned attorneys, for this complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This action stems from a proposed transaction announced on December 24, 2018 (the ""Proposed Transaction""), pursuant to which MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"" or the ""Company"") will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners.
</filing_excerpts>

<target_case>
- **case number**: 2019-0070
- **case name**: Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc.
- **case filing date**: 2019-01-30
- **case count**: COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE; Court of Chancery of Delaware
</target_case>
","**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**

The first step is to confirm that there are discussions around the Target Case in the provided Filing Excerpts. The Target Case is ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070. Upon reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I found that the case is mentioned in the document, specifically in the court ruling and the complaint for violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, I can confirm that the Target Case is discussed in the Filing Excerpts.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**

The next step is to search for explicit mention of the Company agreeing or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment related to the merger, in response to the lawsuit. After reviewing the Filing Excerpts, I did not find any mention of the Company making or planning to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**

Since I did not find any mention of supplemental disclosure, I will proceed to search for an explicit ""settlement"" for the Target Case. However, I did not find any mention of a settlement agreement, MOU, or any other type of agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 4: Search for other Agreements**

I did not find any mention of other agreements related to the Target Case.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**

I did not find any implied agreement related to the Target Case.

**Step 6: Confirm the agreement pertains the Target Case**

Since I did not find any agreement related to the Target Case, I do not need to confirm whether the agreement pertains to the Target Case.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

Based on my findings, I can conclude that the Company did not make or plan to make supplemental disclosure or amendment in response to the lawsuit, and there is no explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case.

Here is the final answer in JSON format:

```
{
    ""supplemental_disclosure"": ""No"",
    ""supplemental_disclosure_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""reached_agreement"": ""No"",
    ""reached_agreement_quote"": ""Not applicable"",
    ""note"": ""Case not mentioned in the context of supplemental disclosure or agreement.""
}
```",X1Q6O2EA02O2,FALSE,no hallucination,"**Step 1: Confirm Case Discussion**
The LLM correctly identifies that the Target Case, ""Luxor Capital Partners, LP, et. al. v. MINDBODY, Inc."" with case number 2019-0070, is mentioned in the document as part of the filing excerpts. There is no issue at this step.

**Step 2: Search for Supplemental Disclosure**
The LLM searched for explicit mentions of supplemental disclosures or amendments by the defendant company in response to the lawsuit but did not find any such mention. This assessment is correct based on the provided excerpts, which do not mention any supplemental disclosures.

**Step 3: Search for Explicit Settlement**
The LLM searched for explicit settlement agreements, MOUs, or other agreements related to the Target Case and found none. This is also in line with the provided excerpts which contain no such mentions.

**Step 4: Search for Other Agreements**
The LLM sought any other form of agreement and concluded that none were mentioned. This is accurate given the lack of such information in the excerpts.

**Step 5: Handle Implied Agreement**
The LLM checked for implied agreements and found none, which aligns with the absence of any such indications in the excerpts.

**Step 6: Confirm the Agreement Pertains to the Target Case**
Since no agreements were found, this step was correctly deemed not applicable.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**
The LLM summarized that the Company did not file or plan any supplemental disclosures or amendments in response to the lawsuit, and there were no explicit or implied agreements related to the target case.

Conclusion:
The LLM's response accurately reflects the information provided in the excerpts as it pertains to the direct task instructions. There is no evidence in the excerpts that the Company filed any supplemental disclosure, entered into any explicit agreement, or had any implied agreements regarding the Target Case. Thus, the LLM did not make a hallucination in its response.

Plaintiff Sunil Kumar (""Plaintiff""), by his undersigned attorneys, for his complaint against defendants, alleges upon personal knowledge with respect to himself, and upon information and belief based upon, inter alia, the investigation of counsel as to all other allegations herein, as follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is a class action brought on behalf of the public stockholders of MINDBODY, Inc. (""MINDBODY"" or the ""Company"") against MINDBODY and its Board of Directors (the ""Board"" or the ""Individual Defendants"") for their violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9, and to enjoin the vote on a proposed transaction, pursuant to which MINDBODY will be acquired by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners through Torreys Parent, LLC (""Parent"") and Parent's wholly owned subsidiary Torreys Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub"" and together with Parent and the affiliates of Vista Equity Partners, ""Vista"") (the ""Proposed Transaction"").

2. On December 24, 2018, MINDBODY issued a press release announcing it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") to sell MINDBODY to Vista for $36.50 in cash for each share of MINDBODY common stock held (the ""Merger Consideration""). The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $1.9 billion.

3. On January 23, 2019, MINDBODY filed a Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (the ""Proxy Statement"") with the SEC. The Proxy Statement, which recommends that MINDBODY stockholders vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) MINDBODY insiders' potential conflicts of interest and the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction; and (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial valuation analyses that support the fairness opinion provided by the Company's financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP (""Qatalyst""). The failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") as MINDBODY stockholders need such information in order to cast a fully-informed vote or seek appraisal in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over all claims asserted herein for violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

5. This Court has jurisdiction over defendants because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations within this District, or is an individual who has sufficient minimum contacts with this District so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

6. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Plaintiff's claims arose in this District, where a substantial portion of the conduct took place, where most of the documents are electronically stored, and where the evidence exists. MINDBODY is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in this District. Moreover, each of the Individual Defendants, as Company officers or directors, either resides in this District or has extensive contacts within this District.

**Step 7: Summarize the Results**

The LLM's final summary, stating that there was no supplemental disclosure or explicit or implied agreement related to the Target Case, aligns correctly with the contents of the Filing Excerpts, matching the task's evaluative requirements.

**Conclusion**
