      "It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\n",

In other words, chemistry is the branch of science about fundamental properties of matter and chemical reactions. Chemistry is the study of the substances and their transformations (or change).\\n\\nHistory\\nBefore 1600, people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold, but no one managed to do that. This was called alchemy. After 1600, using the scientific method alchemists became chemists. Chemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it. They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals. Radioactivity was also discovered. 118 different elements have been found. Some are very common, like oxygen. Many are very rare and expensive, like platinum. Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs, like rutherfordium.\\n\\nSince the 1920s, the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists\\' theories about chemical reactions. With smaller and faster computers, chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances. These tools have been sent to study chemicals on Mars. Police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes.\\n\\nTypes of chemistry\\nThere are several types of chemistry. Analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much arsenic is in food. Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them. For example, making acetylene. Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an integrated circuit. Theoretical chemistry tries to explain chemical data with mathematics and computers.\\n\\nA large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry. This looks at plastics. One example is making nylon. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is biochemistry. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.\\n\\nConcepts of chemistry\\n\\nBasic concepts\\nThe basic unit of an element is called an atom. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay). A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined to form a molecule. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid, that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate, common baking soda. It will make water, carbon dioxide, and sodium carbonate. This reaction cannot be undone.\\n\\nOne very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions. For example, two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule, H2O. This relationship is known as the \"Law of constant proportions\" and leads to the idea of \"stoichiometry\", a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds. For example, in water, there are always exactly 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom. In carbon dioxide, there are exactly 2 oxygen atoms for 1 carbon atom. These relationships are described using chemical formulas such as H2O (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom) and CO2 (one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms).\\n\\nMole\\nBecause atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights, chemists often describe the number of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of \"moles\". A \"mole\" of any element contains the same number of atoms: 602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms. The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.\\n\\nMoles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. Copper(II) chloride is an example. CuCl2 is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45). That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.\\n\\nAcids and bases\\nAcids and bases are common chemicals. Acids release H+ ions when in water, and bases release OH− ions when in water. Acids can react with bases. The H+ ion is taken from the acid by the base. This makes water, H2O. A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together. An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H+ and Cl- ions in water. The base releases Na+ and OH- ions. The H+ and the OH- react to make water. There is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a salt.\\n\\nUsefulness\\nChemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day.\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nMany chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, mercury(II) chloride is very toxic. Chromates can cause cancer. Tin(II) chloride pollutes water easily. Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n\\n Periodic table\\n List of common elements\\n Laboratory techniques\\n Aerosol\\n\\nReferences',\n",
       "   'Biology  is the science that studies life, living things, and the evolution of life. Living things include animals, plants, fungi (such as mushrooms), and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea.\\n\\nThe term \\'biology\\' is relatively modern. It was introduced in 1799 by a physician, Thomas Beddoes.\\n\\nPeople who study biology are called biologists. Biology looks at how animals and other living things behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment. It has existed as a science for about 200 years, and before that it was called \"natural history\". Biology has many research fields and branches. Like all sciences, biology uses the scientific method. This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.\\n\\nBiology attempts to answer questions such as:\\n\\n \"What are the characteristics of this living thing?\" (comparative anatomy)\\n \"How do the parts work?\" (physiology)\\n \"How should we group living things?\" (classification, taxonomy)\\n \"What does this living thing do?\" (behaviour, growth)\\n \"How does inheritance work?\" (genetics)\\n \"What is the history of life?\" (palaeontology)\\n \"How do living things relate to their environment?\" (ecology)\\n\\nModern biology is influenced by evolution, which answers the question: \"How has the living world come to be as it is?\"\\n\\nHistory\\nThe word biology comes from the Greek word βίος (bios), \"life\", and the suffix -λογία (logia), \"study of\".\\n\\nBranches\\n Algalogy\\n Anatomy\\n Arachnology\\n Bacteriology\\n Biochemistry\\n Biogeography\\n Biophysics\\n Botany\\n Bryology\\n Cell biology\\n Cytology\\n Dendrology\\n Developmental biology\\n Ecology\\n Endocrinology\\n Entomology\\n Embryology\\n Ethology\\n Evolution / Evolutionary biology\\n Genetics / Genomics\\n Herpetology\\n Histology\\n Human biology / Anthropology / Primatology\\n Ichthyology\\n Limnology\\n Mammalology\\n Marine biology\\n Microbiology / Bacteriology\\n Molecular biology\\n Morphology\\n Mycology / Lichenology\\n Ornithology\\n Palaeontology\\n Parasitology\\n Phycology\\n Phylogenetics\\n Physiology\\n Taxonomy\\n Virology\\n Zoology\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n \\nScience-related lists',\n",
       "   'Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies. That means stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae are studied, as are supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomy concerns the development, physics, chemistry, meteorology and movement of celestial bodies. The big questions are the structure and development of the universe.\\n\\nAstronomy is one of the oldest sciences. The patterns in the night sky were called constellations by the Arabs. They used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant crops.\\n\\nAstrophysics is an important part of astronomy. A related subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole, and the way the universe changed over time. Astronomy is not the same as astrology, a belief that the motion of the stars and the planets may affect human lives.\\n\\nThere are two main types of astronomy, observational and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy explains what we see. It predicts what might happen. Observations show whether the predictions work.  The main work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the universe.  For many years the most important issue was the motions of planets. Many other topics are now studied.\\n\\nDay-time astronomy is possible. First, there\\'s the Sun, but observing directly is dangerous. It is too bright, and can burn your eyes and can cause permanent blindness. To look at the Sun you need  proper shields and equipment. Some other individual bright stars and planets can be seen during daylight hours through a telescope or a powerful pair of binoculars.\\n\\nHistory of astronomy\\n\\nAncient history \\nEarly astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year. Early civilisations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe. For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it.  This is known as geocentrism. Astronomy is from the Greek astron (ἄστρον) meaning \"star\" and nomos (nόμος) meaning \"law\")\\n\\nAncient Greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements. A mathematician named Eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a sphere. A theory by another mathematician named Aristarchus was, that the sun is the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as heliocentrism. Only a few people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the geocentric model. Most of the names of constellations and stars come from Greeks of that time.\\n\\nArabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.  They also learned from the ancients by translating Greek books into Arabic.\\n\\nRenaissance to modern era \\n\\nDuring the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun. This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism. Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes, and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus. The Catholic Church thought Galileo was wrong. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, who invented the theory of gravity.\\n\\nAfter Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae.\\n\\nModern era \\nThe 20th century after 1920 saw important changes in astronomy.\\n\\nIn the early 1920s it began to be accepted that the galaxy in which we live, the Milky Way, is not the only galaxy. The existence of other galaxies was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy. It was also Hubble who proved that the universe was expanding. There were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding, moving away from our galaxy. That was completely unexpected.\\n\\nIn 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.\\n\\nThe opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example pulsars, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that (so it was thought) it implied an artificial source.\\n\\nThe period after World War II saw more observatories. Large and accurate telescopes were built and operated at good observing sites, usually by governments. For example, Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment. By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.\\n\\nThe next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites.\\n\\nSpace telescopes gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The X-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.\\n\\nFrom 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\n\\nDiscoveries \\nDiscoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.\\n\\nBodies \\nFor convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.\\n\\nSolar \\n Planets\\n Asteroids\\n Comets\\n\\nGalactic \\n Stars\\n\\nDiffuse Objects:\\n Nebulas\\n Clusters\\n\\nCompact Stars:\\n White dwarf stars\\n Neutron stars\\n Black holes\\n\\nCosmic \\n Galaxies\\n Galaxy clusters\\n Superclusters\\n\\nPhenomena \\nBurst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a \"burst\" of energy.  They include:\\n Supernovas\\n Novas\\n\\nPeriodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include:\\n Pulsars\\n Variable stars\\n\\nNoise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it is \"noise\", the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: cosmic background radiation.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nInstruments \\n Telescopes are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter.\\n Spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light. This shows what something is made of.\\n Many telescopes are in satellites. They are space observatories. The Earth’s atmosphere blocks some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but special telescopes  above the atmosphere can detect that radiation.\\n Radio astronomy uses radio telescopes. Aperture synthesis combines smaller telescopes to create a phased array, which works like a telescope as big as the distance between the smaller telescopes.\\n\\nTechniques \\nThere are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration (which is like longer exposures in photography).\\n\\nIntegration \\nAstronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background, until it can be seen.\\n\\nTelescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer, which overlays the images after correcting for movement.\\n\\nAdaptive optics \\nAdaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.\\n\\nData analysis \\nData analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data. This data then has various techniques used to analyse it.\\n\\nFourier analysis \\nFourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.\\n\\nSubfields of astronomy\\nPulsars pulse regularly in radio waves.  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.\\n\\nThis section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy.\\n\\nSolar astronomy \\n\\nSolar astronomy is the study of the Sun. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away. It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar wind hitting the Earth\\'s magnetic field causes the northern lights.\\n\\nStellar Astronomy\\n\\nStellar Astronomy, sometimes generally stellar astrophysics is the scientific study of stars, their formation, evolution and fate (stellar evolution). In the most basic sense,Stellar Astronomy attempts to answer the questions to the universe\\'s most common phenomena — stars. Heavily relating with Galactic and Planetary Astronomy.\\n\\nPlanetary astronomy \\nPlanetary astronomy is the study of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini-Huygens (Saturn) and the Voyager 1 and 2.\\n\\nGalactic astronomy \\nGalactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies.  Studying distant galaxies is a good way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic astronomers try to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed by using different types of telescopes and computer simulations.\\n\\nGravitational wave astronomy \\nGravitational wave astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum.  Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include white dwarves, neutron stars and black holes.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been limited.\\n\\nUnsolved problems \\nGreat discoveries also produce unsolved problems. This is just a short-list:\\nDark matter and dark energy: what are they?\\nUltimate fate of the Universe? What will it be?\\nWhy is lithium 4 times less than predicted?\\nOrigin of supermassive black holes.\\nThe source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\\nThe existence of life elsewhere.\\n\\nRelated pages \\n\\n Asteroid\\n Astrobiology\\n Black hole\\n Comet\\n Galaxy\\n Meteor\\n Planet\\n Planetarium\\n Satellite (natural)\\n Solar system\\n Star\\n Universe\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOther websites \\n\\n Astronomy site specifically designed for kids and their parents.\\n Astronomy Picture of the Day',\n",

Later, with astrophotography and spectroscopy, astronomers (for example Edwin Hubble) showed that the Milky Way was only one of many galaxies. \\n\\nModern cosmology is considered to have started in 1917 with the final paper of Albert Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity. This made physicists realize that the universe changed. When a scientific discipline begins to change an idea that is believed by many people, it is known as a paradigm shift. During this paradigm shift, the Great Debate took place. Many scientists debated if there were other galaxies. The debate ended when Edwin Hubble found Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1926.\\n\\nThe Big Bang model was then proposed by Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître in 1927. This was supported by Edwin Hubble\\'s discovery of the redshift in 1929. Later the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation was made. This was found by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. \\n\\nAll of these discoveries have been further supported throughout the 21st century. Some more observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation were found by the COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellites. Some more observations of the redshift were found by the 2dfGRS and SDSS. These are known as redshift surveys. Survey is this context refers to an astronomical survey. An astronomical survey looks at a place in space. A redshift survey is a survey that looks for redshifts.\\n\\nOn 1 December 2014, at the Planck 2014 meeting in Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% regular matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.\\n\\nKey terms \\n Mass \\n Gravity \\n Electromagnetic radiation \\n Dark matter \\n Dark energy \\n Speed of light \\n Age of the Universe\\n\\nRelated pages \\nString theory\\nEarth science\\nInflation\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nAstrophysics']],\n",

For example, if the LLM responds with \"Accurate\" or \"Inaccurate\", you can set `options={\"Accurate\": 1.0, \"Inaccurate\": 0.0}` to convert these text responses into numeric scores.\n",

      "# Research Report: What are the Different Types of Sciences?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. The sciences are traditionally divided into various branches, each focusing on specific aspects of the natural world, from the study of matter and its transformations to the exploration of living organisms and the cosmos. This report synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the main types of sciences, their subfields, and their interrelationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Chemistry\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemistry is a fundamental branch of science concerned with the properties, composition, and transformation of matter. It explores chemical elements and compounds, their interactions, and the reactions that lead to the formation of new substances. Chemistry is subdivided into several specialized fields:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Analytical Chemistry:** Focuses on identifying the chemical components of substances, such as detecting arsenic in food.\n",
      "- **Organic Chemistry:** Studies compounds containing carbon, including the synthesis of materials like acetylene and plastics (polymer chemistry).\n",
      "- **Inorganic Chemistry:** Deals with substances that do not contain carbon, such as the creation of integrated circuits.\n",
      "- **Theoretical Chemistry:** Uses mathematics and computational methods to explain chemical phenomena.\n",
      "- **Biochemistry:** Examines the chemical processes within living organisms, such as how toxins affect biological systems. Biochemistry is closely related to organic chemistry due to its focus on carbon-based molecules [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Biology\n",
      "\n",
      "Biology is the science of life, encompassing the study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, evolution, and interactions. It covers a vast array of life forms, including animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. Biology is divided into numerous branches, each focusing on specific aspects of life:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Anatomy:** Study of the structure of organisms.\n",
      "- **Bacteriology:** Study of bacteria.\n",
      "- **Botany:** Study of plants (see below for further detail).\n",
      "- **Cell Biology and Cytology:** Study of cells and their functions.\n",
      "- **Ecology:** Study of organisms and their environments.\n",
      "- **Genetics:** Study of heredity and variation.\n",
      "- **Microbiology:** Study of microscopic organisms.\n",
      "- **Molecular Biology:** Study of biological processes at the molecular level.\n",
      "- **Physiology:** Study of the functions of living organisms.\n",
      "- **Zoology:** Study of animals [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Botany\n",
      "\n",
      "Botany, also known as plant biology, is a branch of biology dedicated to the study of plants. Botanists investigate plant structure, function, genetics, ecology, and evolution. Subfields of botany include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Agronomy:** Application of plant science to crop production.\n",
      "- **Bryology:** Study of mosses.\n",
      "- **Forestry:** Management and study of forests.\n",
      "- **Horticulture:** Cultivation of gardens and plants.\n",
      "- **Mycology:** Study of fungi.\n",
      "- **Paleobotany:** Study of fossil plants.\n",
      "- **Phytochemistry:** Study of plant chemicals.\n",
      "- **Plant Anatomy, Ecology, Genetics, Morphology, Physiology, Systematics:** Various aspects of plant science [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Astronomy\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies and phenomena beyond Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses the observation and theoretical modeling of stars, galaxies, planets, and other cosmic entities. Astronomy is divided into two main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Observational Astronomy:** Utilizes telescopes and instruments to collect data on celestial objects.\n",
      "- **Theoretical Astronomy:** Develops models and simulations to explain astronomical observations and predict future events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subfields include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Solar Astronomy:** Study of the Sun.\n",
      "- **Stellar Astronomy:** Study of stars.\n",
      "- **Planetary Astronomy:** Study of planets, moons, comets, and asteroids.\n",
      "- **Galactic Astronomy:** Study of galaxies.\n",
      "- **Gravitational Wave Astronomy:** Study of the universe through gravitational waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related disciplines include astrophysics and cosmology [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Cosmology\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosmology is a specialized branch of astronomy focused on the origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe. Modern cosmology integrates observational data with theoretical physics, particularly the Big Bang theory, to understand the large-scale properties of the cosmos [6].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The sciences are organized into distinct but interconnected branches, each contributing unique insights into the workings of the natural world. Chemistry investigates the properties and transformations of matter, biology explores the diversity and complexity of life, botany delves into the plant kingdom, and astronomy and cosmology seek to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Each discipline contains numerous subfields, reflecting the depth and breadth of scientific inquiry. Together, these sciences form a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe and our place within it.\n",
